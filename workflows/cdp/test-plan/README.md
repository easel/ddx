# Test Plans (Contract-Driven Pattern)

Test plans provide systematic approaches to validating software functionality, performance, and quality using test-first methodology. They transform feature specifications and requirements into structured testing strategies that ensure reliable, secure, and performant software delivery through comprehensive validation of contracts and interfaces.

## Why Use Test Plans in CDP?

- **Quality Assurance**: Systematically validate that software meets requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify and address potential issues before production
- **Requirements Validation**: Ensure all specified functionality is properly tested
- **Regression Prevention**: Maintain software quality as features evolve
- **Performance Validation**: Verify system performance under various conditions
- **Security Verification**: Test security controls and vulnerability protections
- **Documentation**: Provide clear testing procedures for consistent execution
- **Test-First Validation**: Enable tests to be written before implementation
- **Contract Verification**: Ensure all interfaces and contracts function correctly
- **Validation Criteria**: Define clear, measurable success criteria for features

## When to Create Test Plans

Create test plans for:
- New features with complex functionality or multiple user workflows
- Features with specific performance, security, or compliance requirements
- Integration points between systems or external services
- Critical business processes that must be thoroughly validated
- Features requiring cross-browser or cross-platform compatibility
- Complex user interfaces with multiple interaction patterns
- API endpoints and data processing functionality

## Test Plan Workflow (CDP Test-First Approach)

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Review feature specifications and acceptance criteria
2. **Contract Definition**: Identify all interfaces and contracts to be tested
3. **Test-First Planning**: Design tests before implementation begins
4. **Test Strategy Design**: Define testing approach and scope with validation focus
5. **Failing Test Creation**: Create tests that initially fail (red phase)
6. **Test Case Development**: Create detailed test procedures for all contracts
7. **Test Environment Setup**: Prepare necessary testing infrastructure
8. **Implementation Validation**: Verify implementation makes tests pass (green phase)
9. **Test Execution**: Run comprehensive test suites and document results
10. **Defect Management**: Track and resolve identified issues
11. **Test Reporting**: Communicate results and quality metrics
12. **Test Maintenance**: Update tests as requirements evolve

## Test Plan Structure
