# Feature Specifications

Feature specifications bridge the gap between high-level product requirements (PRDs) and detailed implementation. They provide technical teams with clear, actionable instructions for implementing specific features while maintaining alignment with product goals.

## Why Use Feature Specifications in Contract-Driven Pattern (CDP)?

- **Implementation Clarity**: Transform product requirements into technical specifications
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define what is and isn't included in the feature
- **Technical Guidance**: Provide implementation details for development teams
- **Quality Assurance**: Establish acceptance criteria and testing requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify technical challenges before implementation begins
- **Communication**: Create shared understanding between product and engineering
- **Validation Specifications**: Define clear, testable criteria for feature validation
- **Test-First Foundation**: Enable test creation before implementation begins
- **Contract Definition**: Specify clear interfaces and behavioral contracts

## When to Create Feature Specs

Create feature specifications for:
- Features described in PRDs that require technical implementation
- Complex features with multiple components or user interactions
- Features that involve multiple systems or integrations
- Features with specific performance or security requirements
- Features that establish new patterns or architectural decisions
- Features requiring coordination across multiple teams

## Feature Spec Workflow (CDP Approach)

1. **PRD Review**: Start with the relevant Product Requirements Document
2. **Technical Analysis**: Identify implementation challenges and dependencies
3. **Architecture Review**: Ensure alignment with existing system architecture
4. **Specification Creation**: Use the template to document detailed requirements
5. **Test Definition**: Define comprehensive test cases before implementation
6. **Contract Specification**: Define clear interfaces and behavioral contracts
7. **Stakeholder Review**: Get approval from product, engineering, and design
8. **Test Implementation**: Create failing tests that validate requirements
9. **Implementation Planning**: Break down into development tasks with test-first approach
10. **Validation**: Ensure implementation matches specifications and passes all tests

## Feature Spec Structure

Each feature specification follows a consistent structure:

- **Overview**: Brief description linking to PRD requirements
- **User Stories**: Detailed user interactions and acceptance criteria
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation details and constraints
- **API Specifications**: Interfaces, endpoints, and data structures
- **UI/UX Requirements**: User interface details and interactions
- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, throughput, and scalability
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Contract Specifications**: Clear interface definitions and behavioral contracts
- **Validation Requirements**: Comprehensive test cases and validation criteria
- **Testing Strategy**: Test-first approach with unit, integration, and acceptance tests

## Relationship to Other Artifacts

### PRD Dependencies
- Feature specs implement specific requirements from Product Requirements Documents
- Each feature spec should reference the relevant PRD sections
- Changes to PRDs may require feature spec updates

### Architecture Decisions
- Feature specs must align with established Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Complex features may require new ADRs for architectural decisions
- Implementation patterns should follow established architectural principles

### Test Plans
- Feature specs inform test plan creation
- Acceptance criteria become test cases
- Performance requirements become performance tests

### Implementation Tasks
- Feature specs guide development task breakdown
- Technical requirements inform implementation approach
- Dependencies help with sprint planning

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Feature Specs

- **Be Specific**: Avoid ambiguous language and provide clear requirements
- **Stay Focused**: Keep the scope well-defined and manageable
- **Include Examples**: Use concrete examples to illustrate requirements
- **Consider Edge Cases**: Address error conditions and boundary cases
- **Document Assumptions**: Make implicit assumptions explicit
- **Plan for Change**: Design flexible solutions that can evolve

### Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Define specific performance requirements and metrics
- **Security**: Address authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Scalability**: Consider future growth and system limits
- **Monitoring**: Plan for observability and debugging
- **Error Handling**: Define error conditions and user experience
- **Integration**: Address dependencies on other systems

### User Experience Focus

- **User Journey**: Map the complete user experience
- **Accessibility**: Ensure compliance with accessibility standards
- **Responsive Design**: Address different screen sizes and devices
- **Internationalization**: Consider multi-language support if applicable
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Plan for graceful degradation

## Common Patterns

### CRUD Operations
Standard patterns for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations with proper validation and error handling.

### API Integrations
Patterns for integrating with external APIs including authentication, error handling, and data transformation.

### User Authentication
Standard approaches to user login, registration, password management, and session handling.

### Data Validation
Consistent approaches to input validation, sanitization, and user feedback.

### Real-time Features
Patterns for implementing real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.

## Quality Assurance

### Specification Reviews

**Technical Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Requirements are technically feasible
- [ ] Architecture aligns with system design
- [ ] Performance requirements are realistic
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly identified
- [ ] Error conditions are handled

**Product Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Requirements match PRD specifications
- [ ] User experience is well-defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Edge cases are addressed
- [ ] Success metrics are defined

### Implementation Validation

- Verify implementation matches specifications
- Validate all acceptance criteria are met
- Confirm performance requirements are achieved
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Review code against architectural guidelines

## Integration with Development Process

### Sprint Planning
- Feature specs inform story point estimation
- Dependencies help with sprint sequencing
- Acceptance criteria become definition of done

### Development
- Specs guide implementation decisions
- Technical requirements inform code structure
- API specifications define interfaces

### Testing
- Acceptance criteria become test cases
- Performance requirements guide performance testing
- Security requirements inform security testing

### Documentation
- Specs inform user documentation
- API specifications generate API documentation
- Requirements tracking links specs to implementation

## Tools and Templates

- Use the [template.md](template.md) for consistent structure
- Use the [prompt.md](prompt.md) for guided spec creation
- Reference examples for inspiration and best practices
- Integrate with project management tools for tracking
- Link to relevant PRDs and ADRs

## Getting Started

1. Review the [template structure](template.md)
2. Use the [guided prompts](prompt.md) to create your first feature spec
3. Check the examples directory for reference implementations
4. Integrate feature spec creation into your development workflow
5. Link feature specs to relevant PRDs and architectural decisions

## Maintenance and Updates

- Update specs when requirements change
- Version control all specification documents
- Maintain traceability to PRDs and ADRs
- Archive obsolete specifications with clear status
- Regular review to ensure continued relevance

Remember: Feature specifications are living documents that bridge product vision and technical implementation. They should be detailed enough for implementation while remaining flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes during development.
