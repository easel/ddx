# DDX v1.0 Product Requirements Document - Example Reference

This file serves as a reference to the actual DDX Product Requirements Document, demonstrating how a real PRD looks when following the Development Workflow pattern.

## Reference Location

The complete DDX v1.0 PRD can be found at:
**File**: `/host-home/erik/Projects/ddx/docs/product/prd-ddx-v1.md`

## Why This Example

The DDX PRD is an excellent example because:

1. **Real-World Application**: This is the actual PRD used to develop the DDX toolkit itself
2. **Self-Referential**: It demonstrates the workflow being used to create the tool that enables the workflow
3. **Comprehensive**: Contains all sections recommended in the PRD template
4. **Proven Results**: Led to successful development and deployment of DDX v1.0

## Key Highlights from the DDX PRD

### Problem Statement
The DDX PRD clearly articulates the problem of fragmented AI prompts and patterns in development workflows, making it easy to understand why DDX needed to be built.

### Target Users
- Developers using AI assistants
- Teams wanting to share development assets
- Organizations scaling AI-assisted workflows

### Success Metrics
- Adoption across projects
- Time saved versus manual processes
- Community contribution rate
- Pattern reuse frequency

### Technical Requirements
- Minimal project impact (git subtree approach)
- Cross-platform CLI tool
- YAML-based configuration
- Template variable substitution

## How to Use This Example

1. **Read the Full PRD**: Review the complete document at the reference location above
2. **Study the Structure**: Notice how each section builds upon the previous
3. **Observe the Detail Level**: See how specific and measurable the requirements are
4. **Learn from the Process**: This PRD went through multiple review cycles before implementation began

## PRD Template Comparison

| Section | DDX PRD Approach | Why It Works |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Executive Summary | Concise elevator pitch | Immediately communicates value |
| Problem Statement | Specific pain points | Makes the need clear |
| User Stories | Detailed personas | Guides feature prioritization |
| Success Metrics | Measurable KPIs | Enables progress tracking |
| Technical Requirements | Specific constraints | Guides architecture decisions |

## Lessons Learned

From the DDX development process using this PRD:

1. **Clear Vision**: The medical metaphor provided consistent terminology
2. **Scope Management**: Explicit scope boundaries prevented feature creep
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Regular PRD reviews kept everyone aligned
4. **Technical Clarity**: Clear requirements enabled good architecture decisions

## Using This as a Template

You can use the DDX PRD as inspiration for your own PRDs by:

1. **Adapting the Structure**: Use the same sections but customize content
2. **Matching Detail Level**: Aim for similar depth and specificity
3. **Following the Process**: Use the same review and approval workflow
4. **Learning from Iterations**: The DDX PRD evolved through multiple versions

## Medical Metaphor Connection

In DDX's medical theme, the PRD serves as the:
- **Initial Diagnosis**: What problem needs treatment
- **Treatment Plan**: How we'll solve the problem
- **Patient History**: Context and background
- **Success Criteria**: How we'll know treatment worked

## Next Steps

After reviewing this example:

1. Read the full DDX PRD at the reference location
2. Create your own PRD using the template
3. Use the PRD prompt for AI assistance
4. Follow the Development Workflow process
5. Learn from your experience and improve

Remember: A good PRD is the foundation of successful development. The time invested in creating a clear, comprehensive PRD pays dividends throughout the entire development cycle.
