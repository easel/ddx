## DDX Integration

### Using DDX Release Patterns

Apply relevant DDX treatment release patterns:

```bash
ddx apply patterns/release/treatment-deployment
ddx apply patterns/release/treatment-monitoring
ddx apply templates/release/treatment-notes
ddx apply configs/monitoring/treatment-alerts
```

### Treatment Release Validation
