# Development Workflow Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a complete walkthrough of the DDX Development Workflow, taking you from initial concept to deployed product. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a team, this guide will help you leverage the full power of the workflow for systematic, high-quality software development.

## Quick Start

For experienced developers who want to jump in:

1. Initialize: `ddx workflow init development`
2. Define: Start with [[prd/README|PRD creation]]
3. Progress: Follow phase gates sequentially
4. Iterate: Complete the feedback loop

For detailed guidance, continue reading.

## Understanding the Workflow

### The Medical Metaphor

DDX uses medical terminology to make the development process intuitive:

- **Workflow** = Treatment Protocol
- **Phases** = Treatment Steps
- **Artifacts** = Medical Records
- **Phase Gates** = Health Checkpoints
- **Iteration** = Follow-up Care

Just as doctors follow proven protocols to ensure patient health, this workflow follows proven patterns to ensure software quality.

### Core Principles

1. **Document-Driven**: Documentation drives development, not the reverse
2. **Phase-Gated**: Clear entry/exit criteria prevent premature advancement
3. **Iterative**: Each cycle improves upon the last
4. **Quality-First**: Quality is built in, not bolted on
5. **AI-Enhanced**: Leverages AI assistants at every phase

## Phase-by-Phase Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Define (Product Requirements)

**Objective**: Establish clear, unambiguous requirements

#### When to Start
- You have a clear problem to solve
- Stakeholders are identified and available
- You have rough scope boundaries

#### Artifacts to Create
- [[prd/README|Product Requirements Document (PRD)]]

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Gather Stakeholders**
   ```bash
   # Initialize the workflow
   ddx workflow init development --project-name "MyProject"
   
   # Navigate to PRD directory
   cd workflows/development/prd/
   ```

2. **Create Initial PRD**
   ```bash
   # Use the PRD prompt for AI assistance
   ddx apply prompt prd/prompt.md
   
   # Or start from template
   cp template.md myproject-prd.md
   ```

3. **Complete PRD Sections**
   - Executive Summary (elevator pitch)
   - Problem Statement (pain points)
   - User Stories (who, what, why)
   - Success Metrics (how you'll measure success)
   - Technical Requirements (constraints and requirements)

4. **Review and Validate**
   - Stakeholder review meeting
   - Technical feasibility check
   - Resource allocation confirmation

#### Exit Criteria Checklist
- [ ] PRD completed and reviewed by stakeholders
- [ ] Success metrics clearly defined and measurable
- [ ] Technical requirements are realistic
- [ ] Resource allocation approved
- [ ] All stakeholders have signed off

#### Common Pitfalls
- **Scope Creep**: Be specific about what's in/out of scope
