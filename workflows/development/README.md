# Development Workflow Pattern

## Overview

The Development Workflow is DDX's foundational workflow for iterative software development. It implements a systematic approach to building software from initial concept through deployment and iteration.

This workflow follows the principle: **Define → Design → Implement → Test → Release → Iterate**

## When to Use This Workflow

Use the Development Workflow when:
- Starting a new software project or feature
- Establishing development practices for a team
- Transitioning from ad-hoc to structured development
- Building products that require clear requirements and architecture
- Working with AI-assisted development tools

## Core Philosophy

### Iterative by Design
This workflow embraces iteration as a core principle. Each cycle through the workflow refines and improves the product based on learnings from the previous iteration.

### Documentation-Driven
Every phase produces documentation that serves as both a planning tool and a historical record. Documentation isn't an afterthought—it drives the development process.

### AI-Enhanced
The workflow is designed to maximize the value of AI assistants by providing structured templates and intelligent prompts at each phase.

### Quality First
Quality gates are built into each phase transition, ensuring that problems are caught early when they're easier and cheaper to fix.

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Define Phase
**Purpose**: Establish clear product requirements and vision
**Key Artifact**: [[prd/README|Product Requirements Document]]
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks typically

During this phase, you:
- Identify the problem to solve
- Define target users and use cases
- Establish success metrics
- Create the Product Requirements Document

### 2. Design Phase
**Purpose**: Create the technical architecture and system design
**Key Artifact**: [[architecture/README|Architecture Decision Records]]
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks typically

During this phase, you:
- Design system architecture
- Make technology choices
- Define data models
- Document architectural decisions

### 3. Implement Phase
**Purpose**: Build the solution according to specifications
**Key Artifacts**: [[feature-spec/README|Feature Specifications]]
**Duration**: Variable based on scope

During this phase, you:
- Break down work into features
- Write detailed feature specifications
- Implement code following specs
- Conduct code reviews

### 4. Test Phase
**Purpose**: Validate that the implementation meets requirements
**Key Artifact**: [[test-plan/README|Test Plans]]
**Duration**: 20-30% of implementation time

During this phase, you:
- Create comprehensive test plans
- Execute manual and automated tests
- Track and resolve defects
- Validate acceptance criteria

### 5. Release Phase
**Purpose**: Deploy the solution to users
**Key Artifact**: [[release/README|Release Notes]]
**Duration**: 1-3 days typically

During this phase, you:
- Prepare deployment artifacts
- Create release documentation
- Execute deployment plan
- Monitor initial usage

### 6. Iterate Phase
**Purpose**: Gather feedback and plan improvements
**Duration**: Ongoing

During this phase, you:
- Collect user feedback
- Analyze metrics
- Identify improvements
- Plan next iteration

## Key Principles

### 1. Phase Gates
Each phase has clear entry and exit criteria. You cannot skip phases, though you may iterate through them quickly for small changes.

### 2. Living Documentation
All artifacts are living documents that evolve throughout the project lifecycle. They're updated, not replaced.

### 3. Traceability
Requirements trace to designs, designs trace to implementations, implementations trace to tests. This ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

### 4. Continuous Validation
Each phase validates the work of previous phases. Design validates requirements, implementation validates design, testing validates implementation.

## Success Metrics

A successful implementation of this workflow results in:
- **Predictable Delivery**: Consistent, on-time delivery of features
- **High Quality**: Fewer defects reaching production
- **Clear Communication**: All stakeholders understand project status
- **Knowledge Retention**: Decisions and rationale are documented
- **Continuous Improvement**: Each iteration is better than the last

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Skipping Phases
Don't skip the definition phase to "save time"—unclear requirements waste more time later.

### Documentation After the Fact
Don't treat documentation as something to do after coding. Documentation drives development.

### Big Bang Releases
Don't accumulate changes for massive releases. Prefer smaller, frequent iterations.

### Ignoring Feedback
Don't move to the next iteration without incorporating learnings from the current one.

## Customization Points

This workflow can be customized for:
- **Project Size**: Scale phase durations and artifact detail
- **Team Size**: Adjust collaboration and review processes
- **Domain**: Add domain-specific artifacts (e.g., security reviews)
- **Methodology**: Adapt to Agile, Waterfall, or hybrid approaches

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize the workflow**: `ddx workflow init development`
2. **Start with Definition**: Create your first PRD
3. **Progress through phases**: Follow the phase guides
4. **Use the templates**: Leverage provided templates and prompts
5. **Iterate and improve**: Refine the workflow based on your experience

## Artifacts Overview

| Artifact | Phase | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| [[prd/README\|PRD]] | Define | Capture requirements and vision |
| [[architecture/README\|ADR]] | Design | Document architectural decisions |
| [[feature-spec/README\|Feature Spec]] | Implement | Detail implementation approach |
| [[test-plan/README\|Test Plan]] | Test | Define testing strategy |
| [[release/README\|Release Notes]] | Release | Communicate changes to users |

## Integration with DDX

This workflow integrates seamlessly with other DDX components:
- **Templates**: Each artifact has a template for consistency
- **Prompts**: AI assistance for creating each artifact
- **Patterns**: Follows established software development patterns
- **Tools**: CLI commands for workflow automation

## Medical Metaphor

In DDX's medical theme:
- **This Workflow** = Treatment Protocol for Software Development
- **Phases** = Treatment Steps
- **Artifacts** = Medical Records
- **Phase Gates** = Checkpoints
- **Iteration** = Follow-up Care

Just as medical protocols ensure consistent patient care, this development workflow ensures consistent software quality.
