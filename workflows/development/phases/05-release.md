## Tips and Best Practices

### Deployment Strategy

- Use automated deployment pipelines when possible
- Implement deployment validation and smoke tests
- Plan deployments during low-usage periods
- Maintain detailed deployment logs and audit trails

### Risk Mitigation

- Always have tested rollback procedures ready
- Use feature flags to control feature exposure
- Implement gradual rollout strategies (canary, blue-green)
- Monitor business metrics in addition to technical metrics

### Communication

- Maintain clear communication channels during deployment
- Provide regular status updates to stakeholders
- Document all decisions and issues encountered
- Plan post-deployment retrospective sessions

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up comprehensive monitoring before deployment
- Configure meaningful alerts for critical system metrics
- Establish escalation procedures for production issues
- Monitor both technical and business metrics

## DDX Integration

### Using DDX Release Patterns

Apply relevant DDX release patterns:

```bash
ddx apply patterns/release/deployment-pipeline
ddx apply patterns/release/monitoring-setup
ddx apply templates/release/release-notes
ddx apply configs/monitoring/production-alerts
```

### Release Validation

Use DDX diagnostics for release readiness:

```bash
ddx diagnose --phase release
ddx diagnose --artifact production-readiness
ddx diagnose --artifact monitoring-coverage
```

### Deployment Automation

Bootstrap deployment infrastructure:

```bash
ddx apply templates/deployment/blue-green-setup
ddx apply templates/deployment/rollback-procedures
ddx apply patterns/deployment/health-checks
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

- Maintain two identical production environments
- Deploy to inactive environment and validate
- Switch traffic to new environment when ready
- Keep previous environment as instant rollback option

### Canary Deployment

- Deploy to small subset of production infrastructure
- Gradually increase traffic to new version
- Monitor metrics and user feedback during rollout
- Full deployment or rollback based on success metrics

### Rolling Deployment

- Update servers/containers incrementally
- Maintain service availability during deployment
- Monitor each update step for issues
- Automatic or manual progression through all instances

### Feature Flag Deployment

- Deploy code with features disabled
- Enable features gradually for different user groups
- A/B test new features with controlled populations
- Quick feature toggle for issues or rollback

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Triggers

2. **Communication**: Notify all stakeholders immediately
3. **Execution**: Follow documented rollback procedures
4. **Validation**: Verify system restoration and functionality
5. **Analysis**: Conduct post-incident review and learning

### Rollback Types

- **Code Rollback**: Revert to previous application version
- **Database Rollback**: Restore database to previous state
- **Configuration Rollback**: Revert configuration changes
- **Infrastructure Rollback**: Return to previous environment state
