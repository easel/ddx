## Overview

The Design phase translates requirements into technical architecture and detailed system design. This phase creates the blueprint for implementation, defining system components, interfaces, data structures, and technology choices that will guide development.

## Purpose

- Transform requirements into technical specifications
- Define system architecture and component interactions
- Establish technology stack and design patterns
- Create detailed implementation roadmap
- Minimize technical debt and rework during implementation

## Entry Criteria

Before entering the Design phase, ensure:

- [ ] Define phase completed with stakeholder approval
- [ ] Product Requirements Document (PRD) finalized
- [ ] User stories and acceptance criteria documented
- [ ] Success metrics and quality goals established
- [ ] Technical constraints and assumptions identified
- [ ] Development team assembled and briefed

## Key Activities

### 1. Architecture Definition

- Design overall system architecture and topology
- Define component boundaries and responsibilities
- Establish communication patterns and protocols
- Document data flows and integration points
- Select architectural patterns (microservices, layered, etc.)

### 2. Technology Selection

- Evaluate and select programming languages and frameworks
- Choose databases, caching, and storage solutions
- Select development, testing, and deployment tools
- Define third-party libraries and services
- Consider scalability, maintainability, and team expertise

### 3. Detailed Design

- Create component and class diagrams
- Design data models and database schemas
- Define API specifications and interfaces
- Design user interface mockups and wireframes
- Document algorithms and business logic

### 4. Quality Attributes Design

- Design for performance, scalability, and availability
- Plan security measures and authentication flows
- Define monitoring, logging, and observability
- Design for testability and maintainability
- Consider internationalization and accessibility

## Artifacts Produced

### Primary Artifacts

- **[[Architecture Document]]** - High-level system architecture and design decisions
- **[[Technical Design Specification]]** - Detailed component and interface designs
- **[[API Specification]]** - REST/GraphQL API definitions and contracts
- **[[Database Schema]]** - Data model and database structure design

### Supporting Artifacts

- **[[Technology Stack Document]]** - Selected technologies and justifications
- **[[Component Diagrams]]** - Visual representation of system components
- **[[Sequence Diagrams]]** - Interaction flows and message exchanges
- **[[Wireframes and Mockups]]** - User interface designs
- **[[Security Design]]** - Authentication, authorization, and security measures
- **[[Deployment Architecture]]** - Infrastructure and deployment strategy

## Exit Criteria

The Design phase is complete when:

- [ ] Architecture document reviewed and approved
- [ ] Technical design specifications completed
- [ ] API contracts defined and validated
- [ ] Database schema designed and normalized
- [ ] Technology stack decisions documented and approved
- [ ] Development environment requirements specified
- [ ] Design reviews completed with technical team
- [ ] Implementation plan created and estimated
- [ ] Next phase (Implementation) entry criteria satisfied

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Over-Engineering

**Solutions:**
- Focus on current requirements, not speculative future needs
- Apply YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle
- Prioritize simplicity and maintainability
- Use iterative design with feedback loops

### Challenge: Technology Selection Paralysis

**Solutions:**
- Define evaluation criteria based on project requirements
- Create proof-of-concept implementations for critical decisions
- Consider team expertise and learning curve
- Document trade-offs and decision rationale

### Challenge: Scalability vs. Simplicity Trade-offs

**Solutions:**
- Design for current scale plus reasonable growth factor
- Identify scaling bottlenecks and document future solutions
- Use modular design to enable incremental scaling
- Implement monitoring to validate scaling assumptions

### Challenge: Integration Complexity

**Solutions:**
- Define clear interface contracts and boundaries
- Use standard protocols and data formats
- Design for loose coupling between components
- Plan integration testing strategy early

## Tips and Best Practices

### Architecture Design

- Start with simple architecture and evolve as needed
- Use proven patterns and avoid reinventing solutions
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Consider Conway's Law when designing team boundaries

### API Design

- Follow REST principles or GraphQL best practices
- Version APIs from the beginning
- Use consistent naming conventions and error handling
- Design for backward compatibility

### Database Design

- Normalize data to reduce redundancy
- Consider read/write patterns and query optimization
- Plan for data migration and schema evolution
- Document data relationships and constraints

### Security by Design

- Apply principle of least privilege
- Design defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Consider OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Plan for secure communication and data storage

## DDX Integration

### Using DDX Patterns

Apply relevant DDX patterns for architecture and design:

```bash
ddx apply patterns/architecture/microservices
ddx apply patterns/api/rest-standards
ddx apply patterns/database/schema-design
ddx apply templates/architecture/system-design
```

### Design Reviews

Use DDX diagnostics to validate design quality:

```bash
ddx diagnose --phase design
ddx diagnose --artifact architecture
```

### Documentation Standards

Follow DDX documentation patterns:

```bash
ddx apply patterns/documentation/architecture-doc
ddx apply patterns/documentation/api-spec
```

## Quality Gates

### Architecture Review Checklist

- [ ] Architecture aligns with functional requirements
- [ ] Non-functional requirements addressed (performance, security, scalability)
- [ ] Technology choices justified and documented
- [ ] Component interfaces clearly defined
- [ ] Data flows and integration points documented
- [ ] Deployment and operational considerations addressed

### Design Validation

- [ ] Design supports all user stories and acceptance criteria
- [ ] API specifications complete and consistent
- [ ] Database schema normalized and optimized
- [ ] Security measures adequate for requirements
- [ ] Design reviewed by senior developers
- [ ] Implementation estimates realistic and detailed

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- Create proof-of-concept for complex or unfamiliar technologies
- Plan spike investigations for uncertain design areas
- Design fallback options for critical dependencies
- Validate performance assumptions with prototypes

### Integration Risks

- Define clear interface contracts between components
- Plan integration testing strategy
- Identify external dependencies and failure modes
- Design for graceful degradation and error handling

## Next Phase

Upon successful completion of the Design phase, proceed to **[[03-implement|Implementation Phase]]** where the detailed designs will be translated into working software components.
