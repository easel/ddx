# Frame Phase - Problem Definition

This is the foundation phase where we define **WHAT** we're building.

## Purpose

The Frame phase establishes the problem statement, requirements, and success criteria before moving into solution design.

## Next Steps

After completing all requirements, move to the [Design Phase](../02-design/README.md) for architecture planning.
