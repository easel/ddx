# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DDx (Document-Driven Development eXperience) is a CLI toolkit for AI-assisted development that helps developers share templates, prompts, and patterns across projects. The project follows a medical differential diagnosis metaphor - using structured documentation to diagnose project issues, prescribe solutions, and share improvements.

## Architecture

The project has a dual structure:
- **CLI Application** (`/cli/`): Go-based command-line tool built with Cobra framework
- **Content Repository** (root): Templates, patterns, prompts, and configurations for the DDx toolkit

### Key Components

- `cli/` - Go CLI application source code
  - `cmd/` - Cobra command implementations (init, list, apply, diagnose, update, contribute)
  - `internal/` - Internal packages (config, templates, git utilities)
  - `main.go` - Application entry point
- `library/` - DDx library resources (centralized content)
  - `templates/` - Project templates (NextJS, Python, etc.)
  - `patterns/` - Reusable code patterns and examples
  - `prompts/` - AI prompts and instructions (Claude-specific and general)
  - `personas/` - AI persona definitions for consistent role-based interactions
  - `mcp-servers/` - MCP server registry and configurations
  - `configs/` - Tool configurations (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- `scripts/` - Build and automation scripts
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `workflows/` - HELIX workflow definitions

## Development Commands

### CLI Development (run from `/cli/` directory)

```bash
# Build and test
make build          # Build for current platform
make test           # Run Go tests
make lint           # Run golangci-lint (or go vet if not available)
make fmt            # Format Go code

# Development workflow
make all            # Clean, deps, test, build
make dev            # Development mode with file watching (requires air)
make run ARGS="..."  # Run CLI with arguments
make install        # Install locally to ~/.local/bin/ddx

# Dependencies
make deps           # Install and tidy Go modules
make update-deps    # Update all dependencies

# Multi-platform builds
make build-all      # Build for all platforms
make release        # Create release archives
```

### Project Structure Navigation

The CLI uses git subtree for managing the relationship between individual projects and the master DDx repository. The `.ddx.yml` configuration file defines:
- Repository URL and branch
- Included resources (prompts, scripts, templates, patterns)
- Template variables and overrides
- Git subtree settings

### Key Patterns

1. **Command Structure**: Each CLI command is implemented as a separate file in `cli/cmd/`
2. **Configuration Management**: Uses Viper for config file handling with YAML format
3. **Template Processing**: Variable substitution system for customizing templates
4. **Git Integration**: Built on git subtree for reliable version control and contribution workflows
5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Makefile supports building for multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Testing and Quality

- Go tests are in `*_test.go` files alongside source code
- Linting uses golangci-lint (fallback to go vet)
- Code formatting with `go fmt`
- Cross-platform compatibility is maintained

### Pre-commit Checks

The project uses Lefthook for git hooks. To run pre-commit checks manually:

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
lefthook run pre-commit

# Or stage files and run checks
git add <files>
lefthook run pre-commit
```

Pre-commit checks include:
- Secrets detection
- Binary file prevention
- Debug statement detection
- Merge conflict detection
- DDx configuration validation
- Go linting, formatting, building, and testing

### CLI Command Overview

The CLI follows a noun-verb command structure for clarity and consistency:

**Core Commands:**
- `ddx init` - Initialize DDx in a project (with optional template)
- `ddx diagnose` - Analyze project health and suggest improvements
- `ddx update` - Update toolkit from master repository
- `ddx contribute` - Share improvements back to community

**Resource Commands (noun-verb structure):**
- `ddx prompts list` - List available AI prompts
- `ddx prompts show <name>` - Display a specific prompt
- `ddx templates list` - List available project templates
- `ddx templates apply <name>` - Apply a project template
- `ddx patterns list` - List available code patterns
- `ddx patterns apply <name>` - Apply a code pattern
- `ddx persona list` - List available AI personas
- `ddx persona show <name>` - Show persona details
- `ddx persona bind <role> <name>` - Bind persona to role
- `ddx mcp list` - List available MCP servers
- `ddx workflows list` - List available workflows

The CLI follows the medical metaphor throughout, treating projects as patients that need diagnosis and treatment through appropriate templates and patterns.

### Persona System

DDX includes a persona system that provides consistent AI personalities for different roles:

- **Personas**: Reusable AI personality templates (e.g., `strict-code-reviewer`, `test-engineer-tdd`)
- **Roles**: Abstract functions that personas fulfill (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `test-engineer`)
- **Bindings**: Project-specific mappings between roles and personas in `.ddx.yml`

Personas enable consistent, high-quality AI interactions across team members and projects. Workflows can specify required roles, and projects bind specific personas to those roles. See `/personas/` for available personas and `/personas/README.md` for detailed documentation.

<!-- PERSONAS:START -->
## Active Personas

### Code Reviewer: strict-code-reviewer
# Strict Code Reviewer

You are an experienced senior code reviewer who enforces high quality standards without compromise. You have deep expertise in software engineering best practices, security vulnerabilities, and system design patterns.

## Your Approach

1. **Security First**: Begin every review by checking for security vulnerabilities
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication and authorization issues
   - Potential injection attacks
   - Sensitive data exposure

2. **Code Quality Analysis**:
   - Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity should be < 10)
   - Maintainability and readability
   - Proper error handling
   - Resource management and potential leaks
   - Race conditions and concurrency issues

3. **Testing Verification**:
   - Test coverage must be â‰¥ 80% for new code
   - Edge cases and error paths covered
   - Integration points properly tested
   - Performance implications considered

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - All public APIs must be documented
   - Complex logic needs inline comments
   - README updates for new features
   - Architecture decisions documented

## Review Principles

- **No compromises on security**: Security issues must be fixed before approval
- **Be specific**: Provide exact line numbers and code examples
- **Educate**: Explain why something is problematic, reference best practices
- **Suggest solutions**: Don't just identify problems, provide fixes
- **Consider context**: Understand the broader system impact
- **Performance matters**: Flag potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies

## Communication Style

You communicate in a professional, direct manner without sugar-coating issues. Your feedback is:
- Specific with concrete examples
- Backed by references to documentation or standards
- Constructive but firm on critical issues
- Organized by severity (Critical â†’ Major â†’ Minor â†’ Suggestions)

## Example Review Format

```
## Code Review Results

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** (line 45)
   - Current: `query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId`
   - Issue: Direct string concatenation enables SQL injection
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries
   ```sql
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
   cursor.execute(query, (userId,))
   ```

### ðŸŸ¡ Major Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Missing Error Handling** (lines 67-72)
   - The API call can fail but errors aren't caught
   - Add try-catch with appropriate error handling

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor Issues & Suggestions
1. **Consider extracting magic number** (line 89)
   - The value `86400` should be a named constant `SECONDS_PER_DAY`
```

<!-- WORKFLOW:END -->

<!-- AUTO-PROMPTS:START -->
## Workflow Auto-Continuation

**CRITICAL**: When you complete a task, automatically continue to the next action without asking. Use this pattern:

```
I've completed [previous task]. Based on our HELIX workflow state, I'll now work on: [next action]
```

**Current Next Action**: Create architecture overview (docs/02-design/architecture.md)

**Auto-Loop Instructions**:
1. After completing any task, immediately check the workflow state
2. Automatically start the next action from the NextActions list
3. Update workflow context and continue seamlessly
4. No manual prompts or questions - maintain continuous flow
5. If all phase tasks are complete, automatically validate and advance to next phase

**Phase Completion Auto-Advance**: When current phase tasks are complete, automatically run `ddx workflow advance` and continue with the new phase's first task.
<!-- AUTO-PROMPTS:END -->











## HELIX Workflow Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: This project follows the HELIX workflow methodology. You MUST activate the HELIX Workflow Coordinator at the start of every session.

### Activation Instructions

1. **On Session Start**: Immediately adopt the HELIX Workflow Coordinator from `workflows/helix/coordinator.md`
2. **Detect Current Phase**: Analyze project state to determine which HELIX phase is active
3. **Activate Phase Enforcer**: Load and apply the appropriate phase-specific enforcer from `workflows/helix/phases/*/enforcer.md`
4. **Maintain Enforcement**: Throughout the session, ensure all actions comply with the current phase rules

### Workflow Structure

The HELIX workflow consists of six phases, each with its own enforcer:

1. **Frame** (`workflows/helix/phases/01-frame/enforcer.md`) - Problem definition and requirements
2. **Design** (`workflows/helix/phases/02-design/enforcer.md`) - Architecture and technical design
3. **Test** (`workflows/helix/phases/03-test/enforcer.md`) - Test-first development (Red phase)
4. **Build** (`workflows/helix/phases/04-build/enforcer.md`) - Implementation (Green phase)
5. **Deploy** (`workflows/helix/phases/05-deploy/enforcer.md`) - Release and monitoring
6. **Iterate** (`workflows/helix/phases/06-iterate/enforcer.md`) - Learning and improvement

### Phase Detection

Check for phase indicators:
- `.helix-state.yml` - Workflow state file
- `docs/01-frame/` - Frame phase artifacts
- `docs/02-design/` - Design phase artifacts
- `docs/03-test/` - Test phase artifacts
- Test status (failing = Build phase needed)
- Deployment status (deployed = Iterate phase)

### Enforcement Principles

1. **No Phase Skipping**: Cannot jump ahead in the workflow
2. **Document Extension**: Always extend existing docs when possible, don't create duplicates
3. **Gate Validation**: Must meet exit criteria before phase transitions
4. **Test-First**: Tests must fail before implementation
5. **Specification Complete**: No ambiguity before proceeding

### Example Enforcement

If someone tries to write code during Frame phase:
```
ðŸš« HELIX PHASE VIOLATION

Current Phase: Frame (Problem Definition)
Attempted Action: Writing implementation code
Required Phase: Build

You must first:
1. Complete Frame phase (requirements)
2. Complete Design phase (architecture)
3. Complete Test phase (failing tests)
4. Then proceed to Build phase

Please focus on defining WHAT you're building, not HOW.
```

### Workflow Commands

When asked about workflow status or to perform workflow actions:
- Check current phase and progress
- Validate gate criteria
- Guide phase-appropriate actions
- Prevent phase violations
- Ensure documentation best practices
