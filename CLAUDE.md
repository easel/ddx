# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DDx (Document-Driven Development eXperience) is a CLI toolkit for AI-assisted development that helps developers share templates, prompts, and patterns across projects. The project follows a medical differential diagnosis metaphor - using structured documentation to diagnose project issues, prescribe solutions, and share improvements.

## Architecture

The project has a dual structure:
- **CLI Application** (`/cli/`): Go-based command-line tool built with Cobra framework
- **Library Repository** (ddx-library): Templates, patterns, prompts, and configurations synced via git subtree to `.ddx/library/`

### Key Components

- `cli/` - Go CLI application source code
  - `cmd/` - Cobra command implementations (init, list, apply, doctor, update, contribute)
  - `internal/` - Internal packages (config, templates, git utilities)
  - `main.go` - Application entry point
- `.ddx/library/` - DDx library resources (synced from ddx-library repo)
  - `templates/` - Project templates (NextJS, Python, etc.)
  - `patterns/` - Reusable code patterns and examples
  - `prompts/` - AI prompts and instructions (Claude-specific and general)
  - `personas/` - AI persona definitions for consistent role-based interactions
  - `mcp-servers/` - MCP server registry and configurations
  - `configs/` - Tool configurations (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
  - `workflows/` - HELIX workflow definitions
- `scripts/` - Build and automation scripts
- `docs/` - Project documentation

## Development Commands

### CLI Development (run from `/cli/` directory)

```bash
# Build and test
make build          # Build for current platform
make test           # Run Go tests
make lint           # Run golangci-lint (or go vet if not available)
make fmt            # Format Go code

# Development workflow
make all            # Clean, deps, test, build
make dev            # Development mode with file watching (requires air)
make run ARGS="..."  # Run CLI with arguments
make install        # Install locally to ~/.local/bin/ddx

# Dependencies
make deps           # Install and tidy Go modules
make update-deps    # Update all dependencies

# Multi-platform builds
make build-all      # Build for all platforms
make release        # Create release archives
```

### Project Structure Navigation

The CLI uses git subtree for managing the relationship between individual projects and the master DDx repository. The `.ddx.yml` configuration file defines:
- Repository URL and branch
- Included resources (prompts, scripts, templates, patterns)
- Template variables and overrides
- Git subtree settings

### Key Patterns

1. **Command Structure**: Each CLI command is implemented as a separate file in `cli/cmd/`
2. **Configuration Management**: Uses Viper for config file handling with YAML format
3. **Template Processing**: Variable substitution system for customizing templates
4. **Git Integration**: Built on git subtree for reliable version control and contribution workflows
5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Makefile supports building for multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Architectural Principles

**CRITICAL**: The DDx CLI follows the principle of "Extensibility Through Composition" - keep the CLI core minimal and add features through library resources.

1. **CLI Core Minimalism**:
   - The CLI should only contain fundamental operations: init, update, apply, list, doctor, contribute
   - Tool-specific integrations (Obsidian, VSCode, etc.) belong in `.ddx/library/scripts/` or `.ddx/library/tools/`
   - Workflow implementations must be loaded from `.ddx/library/workflows/`, never hard-coded in the CLI

2. **Feature Addition Pattern**:
   - New capabilities are added as templates, prompts, or scripts in the library
   - The CLI is a delivery mechanism, not a feature repository
   - Third-party tool integrations go through the library, not CLI actions

3. **Correct Implementation Pattern**:
   ```go
   // BAD: Hard-coding features in CLI
   var obsidianCmd = &cobra.Command{...}  // Don't do this

   // GOOD: Loading features from library
   ddx apply tools/obsidian/migrate.sh     // Use library scripts
   ddx workflow init helix                 // Load workflow from library
   ```

## Testing and Quality

**CRITICAL**: Always run release tests before committing:

```bash
# Run the same tests that the release workflow requires
cd cli && go test -v -run "TestAcceptance_US001|TestAcceptance_US002|TestConfigCommand|TestInitCommand_Contract|TestListCommand_Contract" ./cmd
```

These tests validate core functionality and must pass before any release.

- Go tests are in `*_test.go` files alongside source code
- Linting uses golangci-lint (fallback to go vet)
- Code formatting with `go fmt`
- Cross-platform compatibility is maintained

### Pre-commit Checks

The project uses Lefthook for git hooks. To run pre-commit checks manually:

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
lefthook run pre-commit

# Or stage files and run checks
git add <files>
lefthook run pre-commit
```

Pre-commit checks include:
- Secrets detection
- Binary file prevention
- Debug statement detection
- Merge conflict detection
- DDx configuration validation
- Go linting, formatting, building, and testing

## CLI Command Overview

The CLI follows a noun-verb command structure for clarity and consistency:

**Core Commands:**
- `ddx init` - Initialize DDx in a project (with optional template)
- `ddx doctor` - Check installation health and diagnose issues
- `ddx upgrade` - Upgrade DDx binary to latest release version
- `ddx update` - Update toolkit resources from master repository
- `ddx contribute` - Share improvements back to community

**Resource Commands (noun-verb structure):**
- `ddx prompts list` - List available AI prompts
- `ddx prompts show <name>` - Display a specific prompt
- `ddx templates list` - List available project templates
- `ddx templates apply <name>` - Apply a project template
- `ddx patterns list` - List available code patterns
- `ddx patterns apply <name>` - Apply a code pattern
- `ddx persona list` - List available AI personas
- `ddx persona show <name>` - Show persona details
- `ddx persona bind <role> <name>` - Bind persona to role
- `ddx mcp list` - List available MCP servers
- `ddx workflows list` - List available workflows

The CLI follows the medical metaphor throughout, treating projects as patients that need diagnosis and treatment through appropriate templates and patterns.

## HELIX Workflow System

This project uses the HELIX workflow methodology for structured development.

### Workflow Commands

Use these commands when working on HELIX workflow tasks:

```bash
# Work on a specific user story
ddx workflow helix execute build-story US-XXX

# Continue current workflow work
ddx workflow helix execute continue

# Check workflow status and progress
ddx workflow helix execute status

# Work on next priority story
ddx workflow helix execute next

# List available workflow actions
ddx workflow helix actions
```

These commands automatically activate a specialized workflow agent that:
- Detects the current workflow phase from project artifacts (docs, tests, etc.)
- Loads the appropriate phase enforcer from `.ddx/library/workflows/helix/phases/*/enforcer.md`
- Applies phase-specific rules and guidance
- Executes work according to HELIX principles

**When to use**:
- User says "work on US-001" → Use `ddx workflow helix execute build-story US-001`
- User says "continue" → Use `ddx workflow helix execute continue`
- User asks about progress → Use `ddx workflow helix execute status`
- User says "do the next thing" → Use `ddx workflow helix execute next`

### Workflow Documentation

- **Workflow Guide**: `.ddx/library/workflows/helix/README.md`
- **Coordinator**: `.ddx/library/workflows/helix/coordinator.md`
- **Phase Enforcers**: `.ddx/library/workflows/helix/phases/*/enforcer.md`
- **Principles**: `.ddx/library/workflows/helix/principles.md`

The workflow agent handles all enforcement logic, so CLAUDE.md stays minimal and focused on project-specific context.

## Persona System

DDX includes a persona system that provides consistent AI personalities for different roles:

- **Personas**: Reusable AI personality templates (e.g., `strict-code-reviewer`, `test-engineer-tdd`)
- **Roles**: Abstract functions that personas fulfill (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `test-engineer`)
- **Bindings**: Project-specific mappings between roles and personas in `.ddx.yml`

Personas enable consistent, high-quality AI interactions across team members and projects. Workflows can specify required roles, and projects bind specific personas to those roles. See `.ddx/library/personas/` for available personas and `.ddx/library/personas/README.md` for detailed documentation.
