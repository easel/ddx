- **Timeline**: Measure after 2 weeks of usage

### M002: Development Velocity
- **Metric**: Time between task completion and next task initiation
- **Target**: <30 seconds average delay for context restoration
- **Measurement**: Track timestamps in .helix-state.yml between task completions
- **Timeline**: Baseline measurement, then monthly tracking

### M003: Phase Compliance
- **Metric**: Adherence to HELIX phase progression (no phase skipping)
- **Target**: 95% compliance with proper phase advancement
- **Measurement**: Monitor phase transition logs for violations
- **Timeline**: Continuous monitoring with weekly reports

## Secondary Success Metrics

- **Measurement**: Quarterly user surveys and feedback collection
- **Timeline**: Quarterly assessment

### M005: System Reliability
- **Metric**: Uptime and error rate for workflow automation
- **Target**: <1% error rate for workflow sync operations
- **Measurement**: Error tracking in CLI operations
- **Timeline**: Continuous monitoring

### M006: Adoption Rate
- **Metric**: Projects actively using workflow automation
- **Target**: 50% of DDx-enabled projects using workflow commands
- **Measurement**: Track .helix-state.yml file creation and usage
- **Timeline**: Monthly tracking

## Implementation Quality Metrics

### M007: Task Detection Accuracy
