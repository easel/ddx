# Feature Specification: [FEAT-005] - Workflow Execution Engine with Observability

**Feature ID**: FEAT-005
**Status**: Specified
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Team/Person responsible]
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Overview
A comprehensive phase-based workflow execution engine with built-in observability that orchestrates complex development tasks through structured sequences of work. The engine enables teams to share, reuse, and iteratively improve complete development methodologies (like HELIX) across projects, directly addressing the critical problem where 73% of developers lose valuable patterns when switching projects and teams spend 15-20 hours monthly recreating existing solutions.

The engine provides a framework for defining, executing, and managing workflows composed of discrete phases, each with defined inputs, outputs, and validation criteria. Through git-based sharing and community contribution mechanisms, workflows become discoverable and reusable assets that reduce prompt recreation frequency from 3.4 times per week to near zero. Integrated state tracking, logging, and audit trails provide complete visibility into workflow execution, enabling debugging, monitoring, compliance, and operational excellence. This foundational system enables reproducible, scalable execution of multi-step processes across diverse project types with full observability.

## Problem Statement
Development teams face significant challenges when executing complex, multi-step processes:
- **Current situation**: Teams rely on manual coordination, ad-hoc scripts, and inconsistent processes that vary between projects and team members, with no visibility into execution state or audit trails. 73% of developers report losing valuable workflows when switching projects, and less than 5% of useful patterns are shared across teams.
- **Pain points**:
  - No standardized way to define and execute multi-phase workflows
  - Teams spend 15-20 hours monthly recreating existing workflow solutions
  - Workflow recreation frequency averages 3.4 times per week per developer
  - Knowledge silos with <5% of useful patterns shared between teams
  - Manual tracking of progress through complex sequences
  - Inconsistent application of templates and patterns
  - Lost context when switching between workflow phases
  - No automated validation of phase prerequisites or completion criteria
  - Difficulty resuming interrupted workflows
  - Lack of reusability across similar projects
  - Cannot determine current state of running workflows
  - Difficult to debug failed workflows without detailed logs
  - No audit trail for compliance and security requirements
  - Cannot analyze workflow performance patterns
  - No mechanism to track state transitions and their timing
  - Limited ability to recover from failures
  - No discovery mechanism for existing workflow solutions
  - No systematic tracking of which workflow versions actually work
- **Desired outcome**: A robust workflow engine that provides consistent, automated execution of phase-based workflows with complete visibility through integrated state tracking, comprehensive logging, and immutable audit trails. Enable frictionless sharing and discovery of workflows across projects and teams, reducing workflow discovery time to under 30 seconds and application time to under 10 seconds.

*Note: This comprehensive feature specification aligns with the DDX PRD's vision of workflow automation as a key mechanism for solving the prompt/pattern fragmentation problem. It addresses the critical issues of 73% asset loss, 15-20 hours monthly recreation time, and <5% pattern sharing by providing a robust workflow engine with built-in sharing and discovery capabilities.*
*All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers must be resolved before proceeding to Design phase.*
*Technical implementation details have been intentionally excluded and will be addressed in the Design phase artifacts.*
