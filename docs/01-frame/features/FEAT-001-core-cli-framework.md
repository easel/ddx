# Feature Specification: [FEAT-001] - Core CLI Framework

**Feature ID**: FEAT-001
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Team/Person responsible]
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Overview
The Core CLI Framework provides the foundational command-line interface for DDX, enabling users to interact with the asset management system through standardized commands. It establishes the core commands (init, list, apply, update, contribute) that allow developers to discover, apply, and share development assets. This framework serves as the primary entry point for all user interactions with DDX functionality.

## Problem Statement
Development teams need a consistent, intuitive command-line interface to interact with DDX's asset management capabilities:
- **Current situation**: No unified interface exists for managing prompts, templates, and patterns across projects
- **Pain points**:
  - Manual copy-paste workflows with no version control
  - No standardized way to discover and apply development assets
  - Difficult to share improvements back to the community
  - Inconsistent command patterns across different tools
- **Impact**: Developers waste 15-20 hours monthly recreating solutions that already exist

## Scope and Objectives

### In Scope
- Command-line interface for DDX asset management
- Core commands: init, list, apply, update, contribute
- User input validation and feedback
- Help and documentation system
- Error handling and user guidance
- Configuration management integration
- Command flags and options
- Multiple output formats for different use cases
- Progress feedback for operations
- Interactive user prompts when needed
- Verbose and debug output modes

### Out of Scope
- GUI or web interface
- IDE plugins (separate feature)
- Cloud synchronization
- Authentication/authorization (handled by git)
- Automated prompt generation
- AI-powered command suggestions

### Success Criteria
- CLI can be installed and run on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- All core commands execute within 1 second for local operations
- Help is available for all commands and flags
- Error messages provide clear resolution steps
- Commands follow Unix philosophy (do one thing well)
- Exit codes properly indicate success/failure
- Output can be piped to other commands

## Functional Requirements

### Core Commands
The CLI must provide the following capabilities:
- **Initialize**: Enable DDX functionality in a project with configuration
- **Browse**: Allow users to discover available assets by category with filtering
- **Apply**: Enable users to incorporate templates, patterns, or prompts into their project
- **Synchronize**: Allow users to pull latest improvements from master repository
- **Contribute**: Enable users to share improvements back to community
- **Configure**: Allow users to manage DDX settings and preferences
- **Version**: Display version information and check for updates
- **Help**: Provide comprehensive command documentation and examples

- Validate all user inputs
- Secure handling of credentials
- No logging of sensitive information
- Respect file permissions
- Safe handling of symbolic links

### Compatibility
- Works on macOS 10.15+
- Works on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+, RHEL 7+)
- Works on Windows 10+
- Git 2.0+ required
- No admin/root required for user install
