# Feature Specification: [FEAT-004] - Cross-Platform Installation

**Feature ID**: FEAT-004
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: Core Team
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Overview
The Cross-Platform Installation system enables developers to install and use DDX immediately across macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms without complex setup procedures or administrative privileges. The system must achieve >99% installation success rate and ensure developers can start using DDX within 60 seconds of beginning installation.

## Problem Statement
Getting development tools installed and configured is often a significant barrier to adoption:
- **Current situation**: Manual installation processes that vary by platform, require multiple steps, and often need admin privileges
- **Pain points**:
  - Different installation procedures for each operating system
  - Manual PATH configuration required
  - Need for administrative/root privileges
  - No automatic update mechanism
  - Difficulty verifying successful installation
  - Conflicts with existing tools
  - No rollback for failed installations
  - Package manager fragmentation
- **Impact**: 40% of potential users abandon tools due to installation friction, and support teams spend 25% of time on installation issues
