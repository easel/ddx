# Feature Specification: [FEAT-002] - Upstream Synchronization System

**Feature ID**: FEAT-002
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Team/Person responsible]
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Overview
The Upstream Synchronization System enables developers to seamlessly receive updates from the master DDX repository while preserving their local customizations and work. It provides a reliable, bidirectional flow for both pulling improvements from the community and contributing enhancements back upstream. The system ensures that developers can work normally on their projects while staying current with the latest DDX resources, handling conflicts gracefully when local changes intersect with upstream updates.

## Problem Statement
Developers need to maintain synchronized access to shared development resources while preserving their ability to work independently:
- **Current situation**: Developers manually copy assets between projects with no automated way to receive updates or contribute improvements
- **Pain points**:
  - Cannot easily pull upstream improvements into existing projects
  - Local customizations get overwritten or lost during updates
  - No clear process for handling conflicts between local and upstream changes
  - Difficult to contribute improvements back to the community
  - No visibility into what has changed between versions
  - Cannot rollback problematic updates
- **Impact**: Teams lose 73% of valuable improvements due to inability to effectively synchronize and share changes

- Selective update application
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Authentication and authorization
