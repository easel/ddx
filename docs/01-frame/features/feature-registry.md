# Feature Registry

**Document Type**: Feature Registry
**Status**: Active
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-14
**Maintained By**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Team/Person]

## Purpose

This registry tracks all features in the system, their status, dependencies, and ownership. It serves as the single source of truth for feature identification and tracking.

## Feature Categories

Group features by type or domain:

### Core Infrastructure
- FEAT-001: Core CLI Framework
- FEAT-002: Upstream Synchronization System
- FEAT-003: Configuration Management
- FEAT-004: Cross-Platform Installation
- FEAT-005: Workflow Execution Engine with Observability

### Authentication & Security
- [Future features]

### Workflow Management
- [Future features]

### Reporting & Analytics

## ID Assignment Rules

1. **Sequential Numbering**: Features are numbered sequentially (001, 002, 003...)
2. **Never Reuse IDs**: Once assigned, an ID is permanent even if feature is cancelled
3. **Three Digits**: Use format FEAT-XXX (e.g., FEAT-001, not FEAT-1)
4. **Reserve Ranges**: Optionally reserve ranges for different teams or categories

## Deprecated/Cancelled Features

Track features that were cancelled or deprecated:

| ID | Name | Status | Reason | Date |
|----|------|--------|--------|------|
| - | - | - | - | - |

## Feature Metrics

Track high-level metrics:

| Quarter | Features Planned | Features Delivered | Success Rate |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Q1 2025 | 1 | - | - |
