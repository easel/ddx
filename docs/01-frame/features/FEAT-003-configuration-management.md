# Feature Specification: [FEAT-003] - Configuration Management

**Feature ID**: FEAT-003
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Team/Person responsible]
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Overview
The Configuration Management system provides a flexible, hierarchical configuration framework for DDX using YAML-based configuration files. It enables project-specific customization through variable substitution, environment-specific overrides, and template parameterization. The system manages the `.ddx.yml` configuration file that defines which resources to include, how to customize them, and how to connect to the master repository. This allows teams to maintain consistent configurations while adapting DDX to their specific needs and workflows.

## Problem Statement
Projects need customizable configuration to adapt shared assets to their specific requirements:
- **Current situation**: No standardized way to customize templates and patterns for different projects, environments, or teams
- **Pain points**:
  - Manual editing of templates for each project
  - No variable substitution mechanism
  - Cannot maintain different configs for dev/staging/prod
  - Difficult to share configuration across team
  - No validation of configuration values
  - Hard-coded values in templates reduce reusability
  - No inheritance or composition of configurations
- **Impact**: Teams spend hours manually customizing assets that could be parameterized, reducing the value of shared resources

## Scope and Objectives

### In Scope
- YAML configuration file parsing and validation
- Hierarchical configuration (global, project, environment)
- Variable substitution in templates and patterns
- Environment variable integration
- Configuration schema validation
- Default values and overrides
- Configuration inheritance
- Secure handling of sensitive values
- Configuration migration between versions
- Import/export of configurations
- Configuration templates for common scenarios
- Dynamic configuration reloading
- Configuration composition from multiple sources

### Out of Scope
- Database-backed configuration
- Remote configuration servers
- Real-time configuration sync
- Configuration UI/GUI
- Encrypted configuration storage
- Configuration as code (programmatic)
- A/B testing configurations
- Feature flags system

### Success Criteria
- Configuration loads in < 100ms
- Variable substitution works in all asset types
- Environment overrides work consistently
- Configuration validation catches errors before execution
- Backwards compatibility with older configs
- Clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Documentation for all configuration options
- Migration path for configuration updates

## Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies
- **Depends On**:

  - FEAT-002: Upstream Synchronization (uses repository configuration)
- **Depended By**:
  - FEAT-004: Template Management (uses variable substitution)
  - FEAT-005: Workflow Execution Engine (reads workflow configuration)
- **Related Features**:
  - All features that require customization or configuration

### External Dependencies
- File system access for reading/writing configuration files
- Environment variables for override values
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Network access requirements for validation?]

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Complex configuration syntax | High | Medium | Simple defaults, good documentation, examples |
| Breaking changes in schema | High | Low | Version detection, migration tools |
| Performance with large configs | Medium | Low | Lazy loading, caching, benchmarks |
| Variable resolution loops | Medium | Low | Cycle detection, depth limits |
| Sensitive data exposure | High | Low | Masking, encryption, best practices |
| Configuration conflicts | Medium | Medium | Clear precedence, validation |
| Invalid YAML syntax | Low | High | Clear error messages, validation |

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Configuration Loading
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens when `.ddx.yml` is missing?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How to handle corrupted YAML files?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Behavior with circular variable references?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum configuration file size?]

### Variable Substitution
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How to handle undefined variables?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Escaping mechanism for literal `${}`?]

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use YAML format for configuration files
- Configuration must be file-based (not database)
- Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing configs
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum configuration file size limit?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Supported YAML version?]

### Assumptions

2. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should we handle configuration versioning and migrations?]
3. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should sensitive values be encrypted or just masked?]
4. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the maximum supported configuration file size?]
5. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we support remote configuration sources (HTTP/S3)?]
6. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum depth for nested variable structures?]
7. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we provide configuration profiles/presets for common project types?]
