# FEAT-012: Library Management System

**Feature ID**: FEAT-012
**Status**: In Development
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: Core Team
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Updated**: 2025-01-16

## Executive Summary

The Library Management System provides a centralized, flexible approach to managing DDx resources (templates, patterns, prompts, personas, MCP servers). It enables consistent resource discovery across development, testing, and production environments while supporting project-specific customizations.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Resources scattered across repository root making structure unclear
- No consistent way to override library location for testing
- Difficult to maintain project-specific customizations
- Ambiguous separation between implementation code and library content

### User Impact
- Developers struggle to understand what files are part of the library
- Testing different library configurations is complex
- Contributing library resources back is unclear
- Project customization requires modifying global resources

## Solution Overview

Implement a hierarchical library path resolution system with:
1. Centralized `library/` directory structure
2. Multiple configuration methods (env vars, flags, auto-detection)
3. Clear separation between code and content
4. Support for project-local libraries

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Library Structure
- All resources organized under single `library/` directory
- Consistent subdirectory layout (personas, templates, patterns, etc.)
- Clear naming conventions for resource files

### FR-002: Path Resolution
- Command-line flag override (`--library-base-path`)
- Environment variable support (`DDX_LIBRARY_BASE_PATH`)
- Automatic detection for development (git repo with library/)
- Project-local library support (.ddx/library/)
- Global fallback (~/.ddx/library/)

### FR-003: Resource Access
- Unified API for accessing library resources
- Path validation and security checks
- Error handling for missing resources
- Support for relative resource references

### FR-004: Migration Support
- Automatic migration from old structure
- Backward compatibility during transition
- Clear migration documentation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Path resolution < 10ms
- Resource loading < 100ms
- Minimal filesystem traversal

### Security
- Prevent directory traversal attacks
- Validate all resource paths
- Secure handling of sensitive configurations

### Usability
- Zero configuration for common cases
- Clear error messages for path issues
- Intuitive override mechanisms

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Working on DDx
**As a** DDx contributor
**I want** the library to automatically use my repo's library/ directory
**So that** I can test changes immediately without installation

### Story 2: CI/CD Pipeline Testing
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want** to specify a custom library path for testing
**So that** I can test with different resource sets

### Story 3: Project Customization
**As a** project lead
**I want** to maintain project-specific templates
**So that** my team uses consistent, customized resources

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Library Structure
- [ ] All resources moved to library/ directory
- [ ] Subdirectories properly organized
- [ ] Old paths no longer referenced

### AC2: Path Resolution
- [ ] Flag override works correctly
- [ ] Environment variable recognized
- [ ] Git repo detection functional
- [ ] Project library discovery works
- [ ] Global fallback operational

### AC3: Integration
- [ ] Persona loader uses library paths
- [ ] MCP registry uses library paths
- [ ] Template commands use library paths
- [ ] All tests updated and passing

### AC4: Documentation
- [ ] ADR documenting decision
- [ ] README updated with new structure
- [ ] Installation guide updated
- [ ] Migration guide created

## Technical Design

### Components
1. **Library Resolver** (`cli/internal/config/library.go`)
   - Path resolution logic
   - Resource location helpers
   - Validation functions

2. **Integration Points**
   - PersonaLoader updates
   - MCP Registry updates
   - Command implementations
   - Test fixtures

3. **Migration Path**
   - Move directories to library/
   - Update all references
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document changes

## Dependencies

- File system access
- Git repository detection
- OS-specific path handling

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Breaking existing installations | High | Provide migration script and backward compatibility |
| Complex path resolution | Medium | Clear documentation and error messages |
| Performance degradation | Low | Cache resolved paths, optimize traversal |

## Success Metrics

- Path resolution time < 10ms
- Zero reported path-related issues after migration
- Successful CI/CD integration with custom paths
- 100% of resources accessible through library

## Timeline

- Week 1: Implementation and testing
- Week 2: Documentation and migration
- Week 3: User feedback and refinement
