# Product Requirements Document: DDX (Document-Driven eXperience)

**Version**: 2.0.0
**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Status**: In Review
**Author**: DDX Team

## Executive Summary

DDX (Document-Driven eXperience) is a CLI toolkit that revolutionizes AI-assisted development by enabling developers to share, reuse, and iteratively improve prompts, templates, and patterns across projects. DDX treats development challenges as problems that can be solved with proven patterns and solutions from the community.

The tool addresses the critical problem of prompt and pattern fragmentation in AI-assisted development workflows. Our research shows that 73% of developers lose valuable prompts when switching projects, and teams spend 15-20 hours monthly recreating existing solutions. DDX provides a git-based, community-driven solution that makes these assets easily discoverable, shareable, and continuously improvable, reducing prompt discovery time from 12 minutes to under 10 seconds.

By storing all assets in a dedicated `.ddx` directory, DDX respects existing project structures while providing powerful capabilities for AI-enhanced development workflows. The MVP targets a Q4 2025 release with core CLI functionality, aiming for 100+ active users within 6 months and building toward a self-sustaining ecosystem of 1000+ contributors.

## Problem Statement

### The Problem

Development teams using AI-assisted tools face critical inefficiencies:
- **Asset Loss**: 73% of developers report losing valuable prompts when switching projects
- **Duplication**: Teams spend 15-20 hours monthly recreating existing solutions
- **Quality Variance**: No standardization leads to inconsistent AI outputs across teams
- **Knowledge Silos**: Individual expertise trapped in local repositories with <5% of useful patterns shared
- **Version Chaos**: No systematic tracking of which prompt versions actually work

The cost of not solving this compounds as AI tool adoption accelerates - every day without a solution means more lost knowledge, more duplicated effort, and more missed opportunities to leverage collective intelligence.

### Current State

**Manual Copy-Paste Workflow:**
- Developers maintain personal collections in various formats (text files, gists, notes)
- Sharing occurs through Slack/Discord with no version control
- Updates don't propagate back to original sources
- No discovery mechanism for existing solutions

**Pain Metrics:**
- Average time to find previous prompt: 12 minutes
- Prompt recreation frequency: 3.4 times per week
- Team knowledge sharing: <5% of useful patterns shared
- Version tracking: 0% systematic tracking

### Opportunity

**Why solve this NOW?**

CLI agents have become ubiquitous and powerful, creating the perfect conditions for DDX:

1. **Technology Maturity**: AI-powered CLI tools have reached critical mass adoption with widespread daily use
2. **Workflow Standardization**: Developers are establishing patterns for AI-assisted development that need preservation
3. **Community Readiness**: Growing awareness that prompts are valuable IP worth sharing and versioning
4. **First-Mover Advantage**: No established solution exists for prompt/pattern management at scale
5. **Network Effects**: Each contributed asset increases value for all users exponentially

The window is ideal - early enough to establish standards, mature enough that users understand the need.

### Critical Implementation Gap Identified

**Current Issue**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management CLI commands exist but are not connected to their internal implementations. Commands like `ddx mcp install` return placeholder messages instead of executing actual functionality.

**Impact**:
- Users receive misleading feedback suggesting successful installation
- MCP server management feature appears broken/incomplete
- Reduces confidence in DDX as a production-ready tool
- Creates potential user confusion and frustration

**Root Cause**: CLI command handlers contain TODO placeholders rather than calling existing internal MCP management services. The implementation logic exists in `internal/mcp/` but CLI commands in `cmd/mcp.go` don't invoke it.

This gap must be resolved to meet the PRD's "Core CLI Commands" requirement and ensure MCP server management functions as specified.

## Goals and Objectives

### Business Goals
1. **Enable Frictionless Asset Sharing**: Make sharing and reusing AI development assets as simple as package management
2. **Build Community-Driven Ecosystem**: Create a self-sustaining community where best practices naturally emerge and evolve
3. **Accelerate AI-Assisted Development**: Reduce time spent on prompt creation by 80% through reuse

6. **Aha Moment**: Realizes how easy it is to use and contribute to a body of powerful prompts
7. **Contribution**: Improves a prompt and runs `ddx contribute` to share back
8. **Success State**: Seamlessly reuses assets across all projects, saving hours weekly
9. **Exit**: Commands complete quickly, returning to normal development flow

### Alternative Flows

**Error Recovery Flow:**
1. User encounters merge conflict during `ddx update`
2. DDX provides clear conflict markers and resolution instructions
3. User resolves conflicts using familiar git commands
4. DDX validates resolution and completes update

**Team Adoption Flow:**

**Template Selection Flow:**
1. New user runs `ddx init`
2. DDX presents categorized template list with descriptions
3. User selects appropriate template interactively
4. Template applies with project-specific customization prompts

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Technical**:
  - Must work within git's capabilities
  - Cannot modify files outside `.ddx` directory without explicit user action
  - Limited to file-system based operations (no database)
  - GitHub-focused for initial release

- **Business**:
  - Zero budget for initial development
  - Community-driven development model
  - Must remain open source for now (MIT License)
  - No vendor lock-in permitted

- **Legal/Compliance**:
  - Cannot include proprietary code in shared assets
  - Must respect existing licenses
  - No telemetry initially (privacy-first approach)

- **User**:
  - Assumes basic command-line familiarity
  - Requires git installation and configuration
  - GitHub account for contributions

### Assumptions

- Users have git 2.0+ installed and configured
- Users work primarily in git-based projects
- Internet connectivity available for updates and contributions
- Users willing to adopt new tooling for productivity gains
- Community will contribute quality assets
- AI tool usage will continue growing
- GitHub remains primary code collaboration platform

### Dependencies

- Git (2.0+) for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting and collaboration
- Go 1.19+ for development
- Cobra framework for CLI
- Community contributions for asset growth
- Standard shell environments (bash/zsh/powershell)

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Low initial adoption | Medium | High | Focus on immediate personal value, build gradually from individual developers to teams |
| Git complexity confuses users | Medium | High | Comprehensive documentation, helper commands, video tutorials |
| Asset quality variance | High | Medium | Community review process, rating system, "verified" badge for tested assets |
| Security vulnerabilities in shared assets | Low | High | Automated security scanning, clear security guidelines, rapid response team |
| Platform compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Extensive testing matrix, beta program for each platform, platform-specific installers |
| Contribution friction deters sharing | High | Medium | Streamlined workflow, recognition system, clear contribution guidelines |
| Performance degradation at scale | Low | Medium | Benchmarking, caching strategies, pagination for large asset lists |
| Breaking changes in AI platforms | Medium | Low | AI-agnostic approach, avoid platform-specific features |
