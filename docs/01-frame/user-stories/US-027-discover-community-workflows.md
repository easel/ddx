**Story ID**: US-027
**Priority**: P1
**Feature**: FEAT-005 - Workflow Execution Engine
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Defined

## Story Description

**As a** multi-project developer
**I want** to discover and apply community workflows
**So that** I can avoid recreating solutions that already exist

## Business Value

- Reduces workflow recreation from 3.4x/week to <0.5x/week
- Eliminates 15-20 hours monthly spent recreating existing solutions
- Increases pattern sharing from <5% to >60%
- Provides immediate access to proven methodologies

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Category Search
- **Given** I need a workflow for a specific type of project
- **When** I search workflows by category
- **Then** I see relevant workflows grouped by methodology type

### AC-002: Keyword Discovery
- **Given** I am looking for workflows with specific capabilities
- **When** I search using keywords or tags
- **Then** I find workflows that match my search criteria

### AC-003: Workflow Preview
- **Given** I have found a potentially useful workflow
- **When** I preview the workflow details
- **Then** I can see phases, requirements, and expected outcomes before applying

### AC-004: Fast Discovery
- **Given** I am searching for workflows
- **When** I perform any search or filter operation
- **Then** results appear in under 30 seconds

### AC-005: Usage Statistics
- **Given** I am evaluating workflows
- **When** I view workflow information
- **Then** I can see usage statistics and community ratings

### AC-006: Filter by Type
- **Given** I work with specific methodologies
- **When** I filter by workflow type (HELIX, Agile, TDD, etc.)
- **Then** I see only workflows that match my preferred approach

## Definition of Done
