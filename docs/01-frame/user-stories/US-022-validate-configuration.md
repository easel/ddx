# User Story: Validate Configuration

**Story ID**: US-022
**Feature**: FEAT-003 (Configuration Management)
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** validate my configuration
**So that** I catch errors before execution

## Description
This story provides comprehensive validation of DDX configuration files to catch errors, inconsistencies, and potential problems before they cause runtime failures. Validation includes syntax checking, schema compliance, variable resolution, resource availability, and connectivity testing. Early error detection saves time and prevents frustrating failures during critical operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** `ddx config validate` command, **when** run, **then** configuration is thoroughly checked
- [ ] **Given** config structure, **when** validated, **then** schema compliance is verified
- [ ] **Given** config values, **when** checked, **then** content validation is performed
- [ ] **Given** variable references, **when** present, **then** they are verified to exist
- [ ] **Given** resource paths, **when** specified, **then** they are verified as valid
- [ ] **Given** repository config, **when** present, **then** connectivity is tested
- [ ] **Given** validation errors, **when** found, **then** clear messages are reported
- [ ] **Given** common issues, **when** detected, **then** fix suggestions are provided

## Business Value
- Prevents runtime failures due to configuration errors
- Reduces debugging time by catching issues early
- Provides clear guidance for fixing configuration problems
- Improves confidence in configuration changes
- Enables automated validation in CI/CD pipelines

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `ddx config validate` command is implemented
- [ ] Schema validation is functional
- [ ] Content validation rules are implemented
- [ ] Variable reference checking works
- [ ] Resource path validation is implemented
- [ ] Repository connectivity testing works
- [ ] Clear error reporting is functional
- [ ] Fix suggestions are provided for common issues
- [ ] Unit tests cover all validation scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end validation
- [ ] Documentation explains validation process
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## Technical Considerations
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: These will be defined in the Design phase]
- Validation rule engine architecture
- Performance optimization for large configurations
- Schema definition and evolution
- Error message internationalization

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: US-017 (Initialize Configuration) must be completed
- **Related**: US-018 (Configure Variables) for variable validation
- **Related**: US-021 (Configure Repository Connection) for connectivity testing

## Assumptions
- Configuration schema is well-defined and versioned
- Network access is available for repository testing
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should validation be performed offline when possible?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is acceptable validation time for user experience?]

## Edge Cases
- Malformed YAML syntax
- Schema version mismatches
- Circular variable references
- Network timeouts during repository testing
- Very large configuration files
- Missing required fields
- Invalid data types for fields
- Conflicting configuration values

## Examples

### Validation Command Usage
```bash
# Validate current configuration
ddx config validate

# Validate specific configuration file
ddx config validate --file .ddx.staging.yml

# Validate with detailed output
ddx config validate --verbose

# Validate only syntax (no network checks)
ddx config validate --offline
```

### Sample Validation Output
```
✓ Configuration syntax is valid
✓ Schema compliance verified (version 1.0)
✓ All variables resolve correctly
⚠ Warning: Variable 'API_KEY' references undefined environment variable
✗ Error: Repository 'https://invalid.repo.com' is not accessible
✗ Error: Resource pattern 'nonexistent/*' matches no available resources

Summary: 2 errors, 1 warning found
Run 'ddx config validate --help' for guidance on fixing these issues
```

### Validation Categories

#### Syntax Validation
- YAML structure and formatting
- Required field presence
- Data type correctness

#### Schema Validation
- Configuration version compatibility
- Field value constraints
- Relationship validations

#### Content Validation
- Variable reference resolution
- Resource path verification
- Repository accessibility

#### Logical Validation
- Consistency checks across sections
- Dependency resolution
- Conflict detection

## Fix Suggestions

### Common Issues and Suggestions
```
Error: Invalid repository URL
Suggestion: Ensure URL starts with 'https://' or 'git@'

Warning: Undefined variable reference
Suggestion: Define variable in 'variables' section or set environment variable

Error: Resource not found
Suggestion: Run 'ddx list resources' to see available options
```

## User Feedback
*To be collected during implementation and testing*

## Notes
- Validation is critical for user confidence and debugging
- Should be fast enough to run frequently during development
- Consider different validation levels (quick vs thorough)
- May need caching to avoid repeated expensive checks
