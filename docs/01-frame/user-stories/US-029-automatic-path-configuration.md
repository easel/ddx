# User Story: US-029 - Automatic PATH Configuration

**Feature**: FEAT-004 - Cross-Platform Installation
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a** developer who just installed DDX
**I want** my system PATH configured automatically
**So that** I can use DDX commands immediately without manual configuration

## Business Value

- Eliminates common post-installation support requests
- Ensures consistent user experience across platforms
- Reduces time-to-first-successful-command

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Shell Detection and Configuration
**Given** I have just installed DDX
**When** the installer configures my PATH
**Then** it detects my current shell and updates the appropriate config file

### AC-002: New Shell Sessions
**Given** my PATH has been configured
**When** I open a new terminal session
**Then** `ddx` commands are immediately available

### AC-003: Current Session Instructions
**Given** my PATH has been configured
**When** installation completes
**Then** I see clear instructions for making DDX available in my current session

### AC-004: Existing PATH Preservation
**Given** I have existing PATH entries
**When** DDX PATH configuration is applied
**Then** my existing PATH entries remain unchanged

### AC-005: Configuration Backup
**Given** the installer modifies my shell configuration
**When** PATH configuration is applied
**Then** a backup of the original file is created

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Works with bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
- [ ] Creates backup of modified configuration files
- [ ] PATH change takes effect in new shell sessions
- [ ] Provides instructions for current session activation
- [ ] Handles custom shell configurations gracefully
- [ ] Works in WSL environments

## Notes

- Must handle multiple shell configurations on same system
- Should detect and warn about conflicting PATH entries
- Configuration changes should be reversible
