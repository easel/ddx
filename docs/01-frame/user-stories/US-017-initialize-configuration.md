# User Story: Initialize Configuration

**Story ID**: US-017
**Feature**: FEAT-003 (Configuration Management)
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** initialize DDX configuration for my project
**So that** I can customize DDX behavior for my specific needs

## Description
This story covers the initial setup of DDX configuration in a project. When a developer starts using DDX, they need a way to create the foundational configuration file (`.ddx.yml`) that will control how DDX operates within their project. The initialization process should be user-friendly, intelligent about detecting project context, and create a well-documented configuration that serves as a starting point for further customization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a project without DDX, **when** I run `ddx init`, **then** `.ddx.yml` is created with sensible defaults
- [ ] **Given** initialization process, **when** prompted, **then** interactive prompts guide configuration setup
- [ ] **Given** a project type, **when** detected, **then** appropriate configuration is suggested
- [ ] **Given** configuration values, **when** entered, **then** validation occurs during creation
- [ ] **Given** a new config, **when** created, **then** example variable definitions are included
- [ ] **Given** configuration file, **when** generated, **then** available options are documented in comments
- [ ] **Given** `--template` flag, **when** provided, **then** specified template is used for initialization
- [ ] **Given** existing configuration, **when** present, **then** backup is created before overwriting

## Business Value
- Reduces onboarding time for new DDX users
- Prevents configuration errors through guided setup
- Ensures consistent configuration across projects
- Provides clear documentation within the configuration itself

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Command `ddx init` is implemented
- [ ] Interactive prompts are functional and user-friendly
- [ ] Project type detection logic is implemented
- [ ] Configuration validation during creation works
- [ ] Generated config includes helpful comments
- [ ] Template flag functionality is working
- [ ] Backup mechanism for existing configs is implemented
- [ ] Unit tests cover all scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end flow
- [ ] Documentation updated with initialization guide
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## Technical Considerations
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: These will be defined in the Design phase]
- Configuration file format and schema
- Project type detection mechanisms
- Template storage and retrieval
- Validation rules and error messages

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: FEAT-001 (Core CLI Framework) must be implemented for command structure
- **Related**: All other configuration stories depend on this initialization

## Assumptions
- User has write permissions in the project directory
- DDX CLI is properly installed and accessible
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is Git required for project type detection?]

## Edge Cases
- Project already has `.ddx.yml` file
- User cancels during interactive prompts
- Invalid template name provided
- No write permissions in directory
- Corrupted existing configuration file

## User Feedback
*To be collected during implementation and testing*

## Notes
- This is the entry point for DDX configuration, so user experience is critical
- Should follow the "convention over configuration" principle with good defaults
- Consider providing multiple template options for common project types
