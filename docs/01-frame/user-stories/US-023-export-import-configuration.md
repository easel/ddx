# User Story: Export/Import Configuration

**Story ID**: US-023
**Feature**: FEAT-003 (Configuration Management)
**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** share configuration with my team
**So that** we maintain consistency across our development environment

## Description
This story enables teams to share DDX configurations easily and maintain consistency across team members and projects. Export functionality creates shareable configuration packages, while import allows teams to adopt shared configurations. This includes handling sensitive values appropriately and ensuring compatibility across different environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** `ddx config export`, **when** run, **then** shareable configuration is created
- [ ] **Given** `ddx config import`, **when** run with file, **then** external config is loaded
- [ ] **Given** sensitive values, **when** exported, **then** they are properly masked
- [ ] **Given** imported config, **when** loaded, **then** validation is performed
- [ ] **Given** existing config, **when** importing, **then** merge behavior is predictable
- [ ] **Given** import operation, **when** initiated, **then** diff is shown before applying
- [ ] **Given** export/import, **when** performed, **then** various formats are supported
- [ ] **Given** different versions, **when** importing, **then** compatibility is checked

## Business Value
- Enables team standardization and consistency
- Reduces setup time for new team members
- Facilitates sharing of best practices across projects
- Supports configuration governance in organizations
- Enables backup and restore of configuration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `ddx config export` command is implemented
- [ ] `ddx config import` command is implemented
- [ ] Sensitive value masking is functional
- [ ] Import validation is implemented
- [ ] Configuration merging logic works correctly
- [ ] Diff preview before import is implemented
- [ ] Multiple format support is working
- [ ] Version compatibility checking is functional
- [ ] Unit tests cover export/import scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Documentation explains sharing process
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## Technical Considerations
To be defined in technical design
- Export package format and compression
- Sensitive value detection and masking strategies
- Configuration merging algorithms
- Version compatibility matrix

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: US-017 (Initialize Configuration) must be completed
- **Related**: US-022 (Validate Configuration) for import validation

## Assumptions
- Teams have shared storage or communication channels for config files
- Configuration contains identifiable sensitive values
- Sensitive values include passwords, tokens, keys (anything with "secret", "token", "key", "password" in name)
- Exports include resource selections and full configuration

## Edge Cases
- Export with no sensitive value detection rules
- Import of corrupted or incomplete configuration
- Version mismatches during import
- Conflicting merge scenarios
- Very large configurations affecting performance
- Import with missing dependencies
- Network issues during remote imports

## Examples

### Export Commands
```bash
# Export current configuration
ddx config export

# Export to specific file
ddx config export --output team-config.ddx

# Export with custom masking
ddx config export --mask-pattern ".*_KEY$"

# Export without sensitive masking (use with caution)
ddx config export --include-sensitive
```

### Import Commands
```bash
# Import configuration
ddx config import team-config.ddx

# Preview import changes
ddx config import team-config.ddx --preview

# Import with merge strategy
ddx config import team-config.ddx --merge-strategy replace

# Import from URL
ddx config import https://company.com/configs/standard.ddx
```

### Export Package Structure
```
team-config.ddx/
├── metadata.json          # Version, export date, etc.
├── base-config.yml       # Main configuration
├── environments/         # Environment overrides
│   ├── dev.yml
│   ├── staging.yml
│   └── prod.yml
├── resources.yml         # Resource selections
└── README.md            # Usage instructions
```

### Sensitive Value Masking
```yaml
# Original configuration
variables:
  api_key: "sk_live_abc123def456"
  database_password: "super_secret_password"
  user_name: "john.doe"

# Exported configuration
variables:
  api_key: "[MASKED]"  # Detected as sensitive
  database_password: "[MASKED]"  # Detected as sensitive
  user_name: "john.doe"  # Not masked
```

### Import Diff Preview
```
Configuration changes to be imported:

+ Added variables.project_type = "web"
~ Modified variables.log_level: "info" → "debug"
- Removed variables.deprecated_setting

Repository configuration:
~ Modified repository.branch: "main" → "development"

Continue with import? [y/N]
```

## Supported Formats
- `.ddx` - Native DDX package format
- `.yml/.yaml` - Plain YAML configuration
- `.json` - JSON format for programmatic use
- `.env` - Environment variable format (limited)

## User Feedback
*To be collected during implementation and testing*

## Notes
- Export/import is crucial for team adoption and consistency
- Security considerations are paramount for sensitive value handling
- Should support both one-time sharing and ongoing synchronization
- Consider integration with version control systems
