## Story

**As a** developer with valuable improvements
**I want** to contribute my enhancements back to the upstream repository

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** I have local improvements, **when** I run `ddx contribute`, **then** the contribution workflow is initiated with clear steps
- [ ] **Given** I'm contributing changes, **when** the system packages them, **then** changes are formatted appropriately for submission
- [ ] **Given** my contribution is ready, **when** validation runs, **then** the system checks that it meets contribution standards
- [ ] **Given** validation passes, **when** I submit, **then** the contribution is sent to the upstream repository
- [ ] **Given** submission is complete, **when** I check status, **then** I see clear submission status and next steps
- [ ] **Given** I'm contributing, **when** I need guidance, **then** contribution guidelines are readily available
- [ ] **Given** I have changes to contribute, **when** validation runs, **then** changes are checked before submission
- [ ] **Given** authentication is required, **when** I contribute, **then** credentials are handled securely

2. Run `ddx contribute`
3. **Expected**: All related changes packaged together

3. **Expected**: Secure authentication, successful submission

## User Persona

- Validation catches 95% of issues before submission
- Successful submission rate > 90%
- Clear error messages for failures

## Contribution Guidelines Integration

The system should automatically:
- Check for CONTRIBUTING.md
- Validate against .ddx-contribution rules
- Format commits according to standards
- Generate PR/MR descriptions
- Include required metadata
