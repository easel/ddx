# User Story: Configure Variables

**Story ID**: US-018
**Feature**: FEAT-003 (Configuration Management)
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** define variables for substitution
**So that** I can customize templates for my project without manual editing

## Description
This story enables developers to define variables in their DDX configuration that will be automatically substituted in templates and patterns. This eliminates the need for manual find-and-replace operations and ensures consistency across all generated files. Variables can be simple values, reference environment variables, or be complex nested structures, providing flexibility for various customization needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** `.ddx.yml`, **when** variables defined, **then** string, number, boolean types are supported
- [ ] **Given** variable definition, **when** referencing environment, **then** environment variables are accessible
- [ ] **Given** templates, **when** processed, **then** variables are substituted using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax
- [ ] **Given** undefined variables, **when** referenced, **then** default values are used
- [ ] **Given** variable values, **when** provided, **then** validation rules are applied
- [ ] **Given** complex data, **when** needed, **then** nested variable structures are supported
- [ ] **Given** collections, **when** required, **then** array and map variables work correctly

## Business Value
- Eliminates repetitive manual customization work
- Ensures consistency across all project files
- Reduces errors from manual find-and-replace
- Enables team-wide standardization through shared variables
- Speeds up project setup and template application

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Variable definition syntax is implemented in configuration
- [ ] Variable substitution engine is functional
- [ ] Support for all specified data types is working
- [ ] Environment variable resolution is implemented
- [ ] Default value mechanism is functional
- [ ] Validation rules are enforced
- [ ] Nested structures are properly handled
- [ ] Arrays and maps work as expected
- [ ] Unit tests cover all variable types and edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests verify substitution in real templates
- [ ] Documentation includes variable syntax guide
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## Technical Considerations
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: These will be defined in the Design phase]
- Variable substitution syntax and escaping
- Resolution order for nested variables
- Circular reference detection
- Performance with large variable sets

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: US-017 (Initialize Configuration) must be completed
- **Related**: Used by template and pattern application features

## Assumptions
- Variables follow a consistent naming convention
- Environment variables are accessible to the DDX process
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there reserved variable names?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum depth for nested variables?]

## Edge Cases
- Circular variable references (A references B, B references A)
- Undefined variables without defaults
- Invalid variable names or syntax
- Extremely deep nesting
- Large arrays or maps
- Special characters in variable values
- Variables referencing non-existent environment variables

## Examples

### Simple Variables
```yaml
variables:
  project_name: "my-app"
  version: "1.0.0"
  port: 3000
  debug: true
```

### Environment References
```yaml
variables:
  author: "${GIT_AUTHOR_NAME}"
  home: "${HOME}"
  api_key: "${API_KEY:-default-key}"
```

### Nested Structures
```yaml
variables:
  database:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    name: "${PROJECT_NAME}_db"
  api:
    endpoints:
      - "/users"
      - "/products"
```

## User Feedback
*To be collected during implementation and testing*

## Notes
- Variable substitution is a core feature that many other features depend on
- Should support common use cases without overwhelming complexity
- Consider providing variable validation and type checking
- May need special handling for sensitive values
