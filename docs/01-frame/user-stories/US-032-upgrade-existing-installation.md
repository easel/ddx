# User Story: US-032 - Upgrade Existing Installation

**Feature**: FEAT-004 - Cross-Platform Installation
**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a** developer with DDX already installed
**I want to** upgrade DDX to the latest version
**So that** I can access new features and bug fixes

## Business Value

- Keeps users on supported versions
- Reduces support burden from outdated installations
- Enables gradual rollout of new features

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Simple Upgrade Command
**Given** I have DDX installed
**When** I run `ddx upgrade`
**Then** DDX updates to the latest version automatically

### AC-002: Specific Version Upgrade
**Given** I want a specific version
**When** I run `ddx upgrade v1.2.3`
**Then** DDX installs that specific version

### AC-003: Changelog Display
**Given** I run an upgrade command
**When** the upgrade process starts
**Then** I see what changes will be included in the new version

### AC-004: Configuration Preservation
**Given** I have custom DDX configurations
**When** I upgrade DDX
**Then** my configurations are preserved and remain functional

### AC-005: Rollback on Failure
**Given** an upgrade fails partway through
**When** the failure is detected
**Then** DDX automatically rolls back to the previous working version

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `ddx upgrade` command works reliably
- [ ] Version-specific upgrades supported
- [ ] User configurations preserved during upgrade
- [ ] Automatic rollback on upgrade failure
- [ ] Upgrade verification runs automatically
- [ ] Breaking changes handled gracefully

## Notes

- Should work regardless of original installation method
- Upgrade process should be resumable if interrupted
- Must handle breaking changes between major versions
