# User Story: US-033 - Uninstall DDX

**Feature**: FEAT-004 - Cross-Platform Installation
**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a** developer who no longer needs DDX
**I want to** cleanly uninstall DDX from my system
**So that** I can free up space and remove all traces of the software

## Business Value

- Maintains user trust by providing clean removal
- Reduces system clutter and potential conflicts
- Enables clean reinstallation when needed

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Simple Uninstall Command
**Given** I have DDX installed
**When** I run `ddx uninstall`
**Then** DDX is completely removed from my system

### AC-002: Binary File Removal
**Given** I uninstall DDX
**When** the uninstall process completes
**Then** all DDX binary files are removed from my system

### AC-003: PATH Configuration Cleanup
**Given** I uninstall DDX
**When** the uninstall process runs
**Then** DDX entries are removed from my PATH configuration

### AC-004: Configuration Preservation Option
**Given** I run the uninstall command
**When** the process starts
**Then** I can choose to preserve or remove configuration files

### AC-005: Confirmation Before Removal
**Given** I run `ddx uninstall`
**When** the command executes
**Then** I see what will be removed and must confirm before proceeding

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `ddx uninstall` command available
- [ ] All binary files removed completely
- [ ] PATH configuration cleaned up
- [ ] User choice on configuration file removal
- [ ] Clear confirmation dialog with removal details
- [ ] Manual uninstall instructions provided if command fails

## Notes

- Should work even if DDX installation is partially broken
- Must provide manual uninstall instructions as fallback
- Configuration backup should be offered before removal
