# User Story: [US-026] - Developer Debugging Failed Workflow

**Story ID**: US-026
**Priority**: P0
**Feature**: FEAT-005 - Workflow Execution Engine
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Defined

## Story Description

**As a** developer
**I want** to view detailed logs for a failed workflow
**So that** I can identify and fix the root cause of the failure

## Business Value

- Reduces time to identify and resolve workflow issues
- Enables self-service debugging without external support
- Improves workflow reliability through better error visibility
- Reduces frustration and builds confidence in workflow system

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Workflow Search
- **Given** I have a failed workflow
- **When** I search for workflow by ID or correlation ID
- **Then** I can quickly locate the specific workflow instance

### AC-002: Log Access
- **Given** I have found a failed workflow
- **When** I view the workflow logs
- **Then** I see all logs associated with the workflow execution

### AC-003: Log Filtering
- **Given** I am viewing workflow logs
- **When** I filter logs by severity level
- **Then** I can focus on error and warning messages

### AC-004: Error Details
- **Given** I am investigating a failure
- **When** I examine the error logs
- **Then** I see the exact error message and any available stack trace

### AC-005: State History
- **Given** I need to understand workflow progression
- **When** I view the state transition history
- **Then** I can see each state change and its timing

### AC-006: Log Export
- **Given** I need to analyze logs offline
- **When** I export the workflow logs
- **Then** I receive logs in a standard format for external analysis

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Workflow search by ID works reliably
- [ ] All workflow logs are accessible
- [ ] Log filtering by severity is functional
- [ ] Error messages and stack traces are visible
- [ ] State transition history is available
- [ ] Log export functionality works
- [ ] Search response time is under 5 seconds
- [ ] All acceptance criteria have automated tests

## Notes

This story is critical for workflow adoption as debugging capabilities directly impact user confidence and system reliability perception.
