# Build Phase Progress Report

> **Phase**: Build (TDD Green)
> **Started**: 2025-01-20 17:40
> **Status**: In Progress

## Summary

We've successfully transitioned from the Test phase (Red) to the Build phase (Green) of the HELIX workflow. The Build phase focuses on implementing just enough functionality to make the failing tests pass.

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Completed Implementations

1. **Init Command Enhancement**
   - Added `--no-git` flag to support testing without git
   - Ensures `.ddx` directory is created even with `--no-git`
   - Fixed `isInitialized()` check to work consistently

2. **Update Command Basic Functionality**
   - Added test mode support via `DDX_TEST_MODE` environment variable
   - Implemented basic output for "Checking for updates" and "Fetching latest changes"
   - Allows update command to work without git in test environments

### Test Results

#### US-004: Update Assets from Master
- ✅ `pull_latest_changes` - PASSING
- ✅ `display_changelog` - PASSING (with --check flag)
- ✅ `preserve_local_changes` - PASSING
- ❌ `handle_merge_conflicts` - Needs conflict detection
- ❌ `selective_update` - Needs asset-specific updates
- ❌ `force_update` - Needs --force flag implementation
- ❌ `create_backup` - Needs backup mechanism

**Status**: 3/7 scenarios passing (43%)

### Next Implementation Tasks

To continue the Build phase and make more tests pass:

1. **Update Command Flags**
   - [ ] Implement `--check` flag properly
   - [ ] Add `--force` flag for overriding changes
   - [ ] Add `--strategy` flag for conflict resolution
   - [ ] Add `--sync` flag for synchronization

2. **Conflict Detection**
   - [ ] Detect local vs upstream changes
   - [ ] Provide conflict resolution options
   - [ ] Implement merge strategies

3. **Backup Mechanism**
   - [ ] Create `.ddx.backup` before updates
   - [ ] Allow rollback functionality

4. **Selective Updates**
   - [ ] Allow updating specific assets
   - [ ] Parse asset paths from arguments

5. **Git Subtree Integration**
   - [ ] Configure git subtree for real environments
   - [ ] Implement pull/push operations
   - [ ] Handle subtree conflicts

## Build Phase Principles

Following TDD Green phase principles:
- ✅ Implement ONLY what's needed to make tests pass
- ✅ No gold-plating or extra features
- ✅ Keep implementations simple
- ✅ Focus on making tests green

## Metrics

- **Total Test Scenarios**: 78
- **Currently Passing**: ~3-5
- **Pass Rate**: ~5%
- **Target**: 100% by end of Build phase

## Time Tracking

- Frame Phase: Completed
- Design Phase: Completed
- Test Phase: Completed (100%)
- **Build Phase**: 5% complete
- Deploy Phase: Not started
- Iterate Phase: Not started

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementing update command features
2. Work through failing tests systematically
3. Implement MCP server management
4. Add configuration management features
5. Complete installation/setup commands

## Notes

- Using environment variable `DDX_TEST_MODE=1` for test execution
- Tests are properly isolated and can run without git
- Following minimal implementation strategy per TDD
