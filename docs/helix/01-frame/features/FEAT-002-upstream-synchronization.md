# Feature Specification: [FEAT-002] - Upstream Synchronization System

**Feature ID**: FEAT-002
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: Core Team
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Overview
The Upstream Synchronization System enables developers to seamlessly receive updates from the master DDX repository while preserving their local customizations and work. It provides a reliable, bidirectional flow for both pulling improvements from the community and contributing enhancements back upstream. The system ensures that developers can work normally on their projects while staying current with the latest DDX resources, handling conflicts gracefully when local changes intersect with upstream updates.

## Problem Statement
Developers need to maintain synchronized access to shared development resources while preserving their ability to work independently:
- **Current situation**: Developers manually copy assets between projects with no automated way to receive updates or contribute improvements
- **Pain points**:
  - Cannot easily pull upstream improvements into existing projects
  - Local customizations get overwritten or lost during updates
  - No clear process for handling conflicts between local and upstream changes
  - Difficult to contribute improvements back to the community
  - No visibility into what has changed between versions
  - Cannot rollback problematic updates
- **Impact**: Teams lose 73% of valuable improvements due to inability to effectively synchronize and share changes

## Scope and Objectives

- Detect conflicts between local and upstream changes
- Provide guided conflict resolution with multiple strategies
- Allow contribution of local improvements to upstream
- Track submission status and provide feedback

#### Version Management
- Display current version information for all resources
- Show differences between local and upstream versions
- Maintain complete change history with attribution
- Enable rollback to previous versions
- Export version manifests for documentation
- Version history retained in git (indefinite)

#### Safety and Recovery
- Create automatic backups before destructive operations
- Provide rollback mechanism for problematic updates
- Validate data integrity after operations
- Support recovery from interrupted operations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Update operations complete within 10 seconds for typical updates
- Support repositories up to 1GB
- Incremental updates minimize data transfer
- Responsive UI during long operations
- Single operation at a time (no concurrent sync)
- No special caching (git provides offline access)

### Reliability
- Operations are atomic (fully complete or fully rollback)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Data corruption detection with integrity validation
- System recovers gracefully from interrupted operations
- N/A - local tool, no availability requirements
- Zero data loss (git preserves all history)

### Security
- Credentials never stored in plaintext
- Support for industry-standard authentication methods

## Validation Approach

The system must be validated against the following scenarios:

### Update Scenarios

- Update with conflicts requiring resolution
- Update interruption and recovery
- Selective resource updates
- Selective file updates
- Force pull (overwrite local)

### Contribution Scenarios

- Multi-file related changes
- Contribution with validation failures
- Reasonable contribution size (< 10MB)

### Recovery Scenarios
- Rollback after failed update
- Recovery from corrupted state
- Restoration from backup
- Git provides disaster recovery

### Performance Scenarios
- Large repository synchronization
- Multiple concurrent operations
- Limited bandwidth conditions
- No load testing needed (single-user tool)

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must work within existing DDX project structure
- Cannot require root/admin privileges for normal operations
- Must respect corporate firewall and proxy settings
- Personal project (no budget)
- Build as needed
- Git subtree only (no custom protocols)

### Assumptions
- Users have basic familiarity with version control concepts
- Upstream repository remains accessible
- Users have appropriate permissions for their repositories
- Network connectivity is available for sync operations
- User has internet for pulling updates

## Open Questions

2. Single user (personal tool)
3. No compliance requirements
4. Developers familiar with git basics
5. No CI/CD integration for MVP
6. Weekly to monthly update frequency
7. Binary conflicts require manual resolution
8. Git provides indefinite retention
9. No geographic restrictions
10. Full offline work, online only for sync

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Synchronization Edge Cases

- File permissions preserved per OS defaults
- Force-push detected, user prompted to confirm pull

### Authentication Edge Cases
- Credentials expire during long operation
- Two-factor authentication timeout
- Corporate SSO session expiration
- Multiple authentication methods configured
- Use git's credential handling

### Conflict Resolution Edge Cases
- Conflicts in generated files
- Binary file conflicts
- Deletion vs modification conflicts
- Directory structure conflicts
- No limit on conflicts (show all)

### Error Recovery Requirements
- All errors must provide actionable recovery steps
- State must be recoverable after any failure
- Operations must be resumable after interruption
- Clear indication of partial success/failure
- Local error logging only, no telemetry
