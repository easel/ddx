# Feature Specification: [FEAT-011] - AI Persona System

**Feature ID**: FEAT-011
**Status**: Specified
**Priority**: P1
**Owner**: Core Team
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Updated**: 2025-01-15

## Overview

A comprehensive persona management system that enables teams to define, share, and bind AI personalities to specific roles within workflows. This system addresses the critical problem of inconsistent AI behavior across projects and team members, where developers waste significant time recreating prompts and cannot leverage proven interaction patterns from other teams.

The persona system provides a framework for creating reusable AI personalities that can be bound to abstract roles (like "code-reviewer" or "test-engineer") and shared across the community. Through simple markdown files with minimal configuration, teams can ensure consistent, high-quality AI interactions while maintaining flexibility for project-specific preferences.

## Problem Statement

**Current situation**: Development teams interact with AI assistants using ad-hoc prompts that vary wildly between developers, projects, and sessions. There's no mechanism to capture and share successful AI interaction patterns, leading to inconsistent quality and repeated effort.

**Pain points**:
- No standardized way to define reusable AI personalities
- Each developer creates prompts from scratch, averaging 3-5 custom prompts per day
- Inconsistent AI behavior across team members working on same project
- Loss of refined prompts when switching projects or team members leave
- Workflows cannot specify required expertise levels or approaches
- No way to share proven AI interaction patterns with community
- Time wasted recreating similar prompts across teams
- Quality variance in AI outputs due to prompt inconsistency
- No mechanism for workflow authors to ensure appropriate AI assistance

**Desired outcome**: A robust persona system that provides consistent, high-quality AI interactions through shareable personality definitions. Enable teams to bind specific personas to roles, load multiple personas for team simulation, and contribute proven personas back to the community.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Persona Definition**:
- Define personas as markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Support multiple roles per persona (one persona can fulfill multiple roles)
- Include personality, approach, principles, and expertise areas
- No complex schema - just markdown with minimal metadata
- Support tags for discovery and categorization
- Version personas for evolution over time

**Persona Management**:
- List all available personas with filtering by role and tags
- Show detailed persona information including roles and description
- Search personas by capability or domain
- Track persona usage (which are most popular)
- Support persona updates through git

**Role Binding**:
- Bind specific personas to abstract roles at project level
- Support workflow-specific overrides
- Show current role â†’ persona bindings
- Unbind roles when needed
- Default bindings for common roles

**Interactive Session Support**:
- Load all bound personas with single command (`ddx persona load`)
- Load specific persona by name
- Load persona for specific role
- Inject personas into CLAUDE.md for AI session
- Support multiple active personas (team simulation)
- Clear status of loaded personas

**Workflow Integration**:
- Workflows specify required roles (not specific personas)
- Automatic persona selection based on project bindings
- Combine persona with artifact prompts for generation
- Support phase-level and artifact-level role requirements
- Fallback to prompting user if no persona bound

**Community Sharing**:
- Share personas through main repository
- Simple PR process for contributing personas
- No separate "community" folder - all personas equal
- Natural selection through usage and improvement
- Fork and modify existing personas

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**:
- Persona loading time: < 500ms
- CLAUDE.md update time: < 200ms
- Support for 100+ persona definitions
- Minimal overhead during workflow execution

**Usability**:
- Simple, intuitive CLI commands
- Clear feedback on persona operations
- Helpful error messages
- Easy persona creation from template

**Compatibility**:
- Backwards compatible with existing workflows
- Workflows without roles continue to work
- Direct prompt execution still supported
- Gradual adoption path

**Portability**:
- Personas work with any AI system (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- No vendor lock-in
- Standard markdown format
- Git-friendly for version control

## User Stories

### Core User Stories

**[US-030] Developer Loading Personas for Session**
As a developer, I want to load all my project's bound personas with a single command so that my AI assistant can switch between appropriate personalities based on context.

**[US-031] Team Lead Binding Personas to Roles**
As a team lead, I want to bind specific personas to roles in my project configuration so that all team members use consistent AI personalities.

**[US-032] Workflow Author Requiring Roles**
As a workflow author, I want to specify required roles for phases and artifacts so that appropriate expertise is applied regardless of which specific persona is used.

**[US-033] Developer Contributing Personas**
As a developer, I want to contribute my refined personas to the community so others can benefit from my interaction patterns.

**[US-034] Developer Discovering Personas**
As a developer, I want to discover personas by role and tags so I can find appropriate personalities for my needs.

**[US-035] Developer Overriding Workflow Personas**
As a developer, I want to override the default persona for a specific workflow so I can use a different approach when needed.

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

**Missing Personas**:
- If referenced persona doesn't exist, show clear error with available alternatives
- Fallback to prompting user to select from personas that fulfill the role
- Continue without persona if user chooses (backwards compatibility)

**Multiple Personas for Role**:
- If multiple personas can fulfill a role and none is bound, prompt user to choose
- Remember choice for session (don't prompt repeatedly)
- Suggest adding binding to configuration

**Conflicting Configurations**:
- Workflow overrides take precedence over default bindings
- Explicit persona loading overrides all configurations
- Clear precedence: explicit > workflow override > project default

**Invalid Persona Format**:
- Skip invalid personas with warning
- Show what's wrong (missing frontmatter, invalid YAML)
- Continue loading valid personas

**Large Persona Sets**:
- Lazy loading - only read personas when needed
- Cache parsed personas for session
- Support pagination in list command

## Success Metrics

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Git-based sharing mechanism
- No complex schemas or validation

### Assumptions
- Users understand role vs persona distinction
- Projects will standardize on common roles

- AI systems can effectively switch contexts with multiple personas
- Markdown format sufficient for persona definition

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**:

- Persona marketplace or ratings
- Dynamic persona modification during execution
- Persona composition (combining multiple personas)
- AI-specific persona formats (vendor lock-in)
- Paid or premium personas
- Persona authentication or licensing

## Open Questions

1. Should personas support inheritance (base personas)?
   - Decision: No, keep it simple - copy and modify instead

2. How to handle persona versioning?
   - Decision: Use git versioning, no special mechanism

3. Should we support private team persona repositories?
   - Decision: Future enhancement, start with public sharing

4. How to prevent low-quality persona contributions?
   - Decision: Natural selection through usage and PR review

5. Should personas include example interactions?
   - Decision: Yes, helpful for understanding persona behavior
