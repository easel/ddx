# Feature Specification: [FEAT-003] - Configuration Management

**Feature ID**: FEAT-003
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: Core Team
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Overview
The Configuration Management system provides a flexible, hierarchical configuration framework for DDX using YAML-based configuration files. It enables project-specific customization through variable substitution, environment-specific overrides, and template parameterization. The system manages the `.ddx.yml` configuration file that defines which resources to include, how to customize them, and how to connect to the master repository. This allows teams to maintain consistent configurations while adapting DDX to their specific needs and workflows.

## Problem Statement
Projects need customizable configuration to adapt shared assets to their specific requirements:
- **Current situation**: No standardized way to customize templates and patterns for different projects, environments, or teams
- **Pain points**:
  - Manual editing of templates for each project
  - No variable substitution mechanism
  - Cannot maintain different configs for dev/staging/prod
  - Difficult to share configuration across team
  - No validation of configuration values
  - Hard-coded values in templates reduce reusability
  - No inheritance or composition of configurations
- **Impact**: Teams spend hours manually customizing assets that could be parameterized, reducing the value of shared resources

## Scope and Objectives

### In Scope
- YAML configuration file parsing and validation
- Hierarchical configuration (global, project, environment)
- Variable substitution in templates and patterns
- Environment variable integration
- Configuration schema validation
- Default values and overrides
- Configuration inheritance
- Secure handling of sensitive values
- Configuration migration between versions
- Import/export of configurations
- Configuration templates for common scenarios
- Dynamic configuration reloading
- Configuration composition from multiple sources

### Out of Scope
- Database-backed configuration
- Remote configuration servers
- Real-time configuration sync
- Configuration UI/GUI
- Encrypted configuration storage
- Configuration as code (programmatic)
- A/B testing configurations
- Feature flags system

### Success Criteria
- Configuration loads in < 100ms
- Variable substitution works in all asset types
- Environment overrides work consistently
- Configuration validation catches errors before execution
- Backwards compatibility with older configs
- Clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Documentation for all configuration options
- Migration path for configuration updates

## Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies
- **Depends On**:
  - FEAT-001: Core CLI Framework (provides command structure for config commands)
  - FEAT-002: Upstream Synchronization (uses repository configuration)
- **Depended By**:
  - FEAT-004: Template Management (uses variable substitution)
  - FEAT-005: Workflow Execution Engine (reads workflow configuration)
- **Related Features**:
  - All features that require customization or configuration

### External Dependencies
- File system access for reading/writing configuration files
- Environment variables for override values
- Network access for repository URL validation during update/contribute only

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Complex configuration syntax | High | Medium | Simple defaults, good documentation, examples |
| Breaking changes in schema | High | Low | Version detection, migration tools |
| Performance with large configs | Medium | Low | Lazy loading, caching, benchmarks |
| Variable resolution loops | Medium | Low | Cycle detection, depth limits |
| Sensitive data exposure | High | Low | Masking, encryption, best practices |
| Configuration conflicts | Medium | Medium | Clear precedence, validation |
| Invalid YAML syntax | Low | High | Clear error messages, validation |

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Configuration Loading
- When `.ddx.yml` is missing: Use sensible defaults, prompt user to run `ddx init`
- Corrupted YAML files: Display clear syntax error with line number, suggest fix
- Circular variable references: Detect cycles, fail with clear error showing cycle path
- Maximum configuration file size: 1MB (reasonable for text configuration)

### Variable Substitution
- Undefined variables: Fail with clear error listing missing variables and expected values
- Escaping mechanism: Use `$${variable}` for literal `${variable}` output
- Maximum variable nesting depth: 10 levels to prevent infinite recursion
- Recursive variables: Detect and fail with clear cycle error, max 10 depth

### Environment Overrides
- Override precedence: CLI flags > environment variables > .ddx.yml > defaults
- Incompatible overrides: Schema validation fails with clear type/format error
- Missing environment files: Gracefully skip, use next precedence level

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use YAML format for configuration files
- Configuration must be file-based (not database)
- Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing configs
- Configuration file size limit: 1MB for practical text-based configuration
- YAML version: YAML 1.2 specification for modern compatibility

### Assumptions
- Projects have write access to their directory for `.ddx.yml`
- Environment variables are accessible from the CLI
- Users understand basic YAML syntax
- Git availability: Required for repository operations, checked during validation
- Network access: Only for repository URL validation, graceful offline degradation

## Open Questions

1. JSON support: Not in MVP, focus on YAML for human readability
2. Configuration versioning: Schema version field, migration warnings for old formats
3. Sensitive values: No secrets in config, use environment variables for sensitive data
4. Maximum file size: 1MB for configuration files
5. Remote configuration: Not in MVP, local file-based only
6. Variable nesting depth: Maximum 10 levels for practical use
7. Configuration profiles: Templates available via `ddx init --template=<type>`
8. Dynamic reloading: Not in MVP, restart DDX commands for config changes
9. Team conflicts: Use .ddx.yml in git, document team conventions clearly
10. Conditional logic: Not in MVP, keep configuration simple and declarative
