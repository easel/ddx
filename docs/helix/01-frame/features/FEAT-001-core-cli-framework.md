# Feature Specification: [FEAT-001] - Core CLI Framework

**Feature ID**: FEAT-001
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P0
**Owner**: Core Team
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-18

## Overview
The Core CLI Framework provides the foundational command-line interface for DDX, enabling users to interact with the asset management system through standardized commands. It follows a noun-verb command structure (e.g., `ddx prompts list`, `ddx templates apply`) for better organization and discoverability. The framework establishes both core project commands (init, diagnose, update, contribute) and resource-specific commands that allow developers to discover, apply, and share development assets. This framework serves as the primary entry point for all user interactions with DDX functionality.

## Problem Statement
Development teams need a consistent, intuitive command-line interface to interact with DDX's asset management capabilities:
- **Current situation**: No unified interface exists for managing prompts, templates, and patterns across projects
- **Pain points**:
  - Manual copy-paste workflows with no version control
  - No standardized way to discover and apply development assets
  - Difficult to share improvements back to the community
  - Inconsistent command patterns across different tools
- **Impact**: Developers waste 15-20 hours monthly recreating solutions that already exist

## Scope and Objectives

### In Scope
- Command-line interface for DDX asset management
- Core project commands: init, diagnose, update, contribute
- Resource commands following noun-verb structure:
  - `ddx prompts list/show` for AI prompts
  - `ddx templates list/apply` for project templates
  - `ddx patterns list/apply` for code patterns
  - `ddx persona list/show/bind/load` for AI personas
  - `ddx mcp list/show` for MCP servers
  - `ddx workflows list/show/run` for workflows
- User input validation and feedback
- Help and documentation system
- Error handling and user guidance
- Configuration management integration
- Command flags and options
- Multiple output formats for different use cases
- Progress feedback for operations
- Interactive user prompts when needed
- Verbose and debug output modes
- Centralized library path resolution (no hardcoded ~/.ddx)

### Out of Scope
- GUI or web interface
- IDE plugins (separate feature)
- Cloud synchronization
- Authentication/authorization (handled by git)
- Automated prompt generation
- AI-powered command suggestions

### Success Criteria
- CLI can be installed and run on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- All core commands execute within 1 second for local operations
- Help is available for all commands and flags
- Error messages provide clear resolution steps
- Commands follow Unix philosophy (do one thing well)
- Exit codes properly indicate success/failure
- Output can be piped to other commands
- Noun-verb structure provides intuitive command discovery
- Tab completion works for resource types and actions
- Library path resolution works in development and production modes

## Functional Requirements

### Core Commands
The CLI follows a noun-verb command structure for better organization and discoverability.

#### Project-Level Commands
- **Initialize** (`ddx init`): Enable DDX functionality in a project with configuration
- **Diagnose** (`ddx diagnose`): Analyze project health and suggest improvements
- **Update** (`ddx update`): Pull latest improvements from master repository
- **Contribute** (`ddx contribute`): Share improvements back to community
- **Version** (`ddx version`): Display version information and check for updates
- **Help** (`ddx help`): Provide comprehensive command documentation and examples

#### Resource Commands (Noun-Verb Structure)
Each resource type has its own command namespace with consistent actions:

**Prompts** (`ddx prompts`)
- `list`: Browse available AI prompts
- `show <name>`: Display a specific prompt
- `list --verbose`: Show all prompt files recursively

**Templates** (`ddx templates`)
- `list`: Browse available project templates
- `show <name>`: Display template details
- `apply <name>`: Apply template to current project

**Patterns** (`ddx patterns`)
- `list`: Browse available code patterns
- `show <name>`: Display pattern details
- `apply <name>`: Apply pattern to project

**Personas** (`ddx persona`)
- `list`: Browse available AI personas
- `show <name>`: Display persona details
- `bind <role> <name>`: Bind persona to role
- `load`: Load personas into CLAUDE.md

**MCP Servers** (`ddx mcp`)
- `list`: Browse available MCP servers
- `show <name>`: Display server details

**Workflows** (`ddx workflows`)
- `list`: Browse available workflows
- `show <name>`: Display workflow details
- `run <name>`: Execute workflow

### User Interaction Requirements
- Users must receive clear feedback on operation success or failure
- User inputs must be validated before operations begin
- Destructive operations requiring confirmation: init (if .ddx.yml exists), update (overwrites local changes), contribute (pushes to remote)
- Operations >500ms need progress indicators: git clone/fetch, network downloads, large file processing
- Users must be able to use commands both interactively and programmatically
- Output formats: human-readable text (default), JSON for scripting, quiet mode for CI/CD

### Configuration Management
- Support hierarchical configuration (global, project, environment)
- Configuration parameters: repository.url, repository.branch, library_path, templates.exclude, patterns.include, variables.*, verbosity, persona_bindings.*
- Default values: verbosity=info, repository.branch=main, templates.exclude=[], patterns.include=["*"]
- Library path resolution priority:
  1. Command-line flag (`--library-base-path`)
  2. Environment variable (`DDX_LIBRARY_BASE_PATH`)
  3. Config file (`library_path` in `.ddx.yml`)
  4. Development mode (`./library` when in DDX repo)
  5. Project library (`.ddx/library/`)
  6. Global fallback (`~/.ddx/library/`)
- Configuration changes must be validated before saving
- Must support import/export of configurations

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics

- Local operation completion: < 100ms for simple ops, < 500ms for complex
- Network operation feedback: Progress indicators for operations >500ms

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Git subtree command failures | High | Medium | Robust error handling, fallback strategies, clear logging |
| Platform compatibility issues | High | Medium | Extensive testing matrix, beta program |
| Command naming conflicts | Medium | Low | Unique command prefix, validate against common tools |
| Poor error messages | Medium | Medium | Error message standards, user testing |
| Slow startup on large projects | Medium | Low | Lazy loading, efficient file scanning, performance monitoring |
| Complex command syntax | High | Medium | User testing, examples, shortcuts |

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Initialization Edge Cases
- If DDX is already initialized: Prompt user for confirmation before overwriting .ddx.yml
- Incompatible project structures: Warn user and suggest compatible directory layout
- When git is not installed: Fail fast with clear message to install git 2.0+

### Asset Application Edge Cases
- File conflicts during apply: Prompt for overwrite, skip, or merge options
- Missing required variables: Fail with clear message listing required variables
- Partial application failures: Rollback changes, report which files failed and why

### Update and Sync Edge Cases
- Merge conflicts during update: Abort operation, provide manual merge instructions
- Network unavailable during update: Fail with retry suggestion and offline mode guidance
- Corrupted remote data: Verify checksums, fail with clear error, suggest repository re-clone

### General Error Handling
- All errors must provide actionable resolution steps
- Failed operations must not leave system in inconsistent state
- Critical operations must support rollback or recovery

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Operating systems supported: macOS 11+, Ubuntu 20.04+, Windows 10+
- Dependencies: Git 2.0+, Go 1.21+ for building, standard shell environments
- Installation privileges: No admin/root required, user-level installation only
- Shell support: bash, zsh, PowerShell for path configuration

### Business Constraints
- Licensing: MIT or Apache 2.0, open source friendly
- Support: Single user focus, no multi-user features in MVP
- Backward compatibility: Support previous config format with migration warnings

### Assumptions
- Users have basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Users have git installed and configured
- Network connectivity available for update/contribute operations
- Users have write permissions in their project directories
