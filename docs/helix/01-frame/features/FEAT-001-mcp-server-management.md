# FEAT-001: MCP Server Management

## Feature Overview

**Feature ID**: FEAT-001  
**Feature Name**: MCP Server Management  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: In Frame  
**Owner**: DDx CLI Team  
**Created**: 2025-01-15  
**Updated**: 2025-01-15  

## Problem Statement

Developers using Claude Code and Claude Desktop struggle with discovering, downloading, and configuring MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The current process requires:
- Manual discovery of available MCP servers across various repositories
- Complex manual configuration of JSON files with proper paths and environment variables
- No standardized way to share MCP configurations across teams
- Risk of exposing sensitive credentials in configuration files
- Platform-specific configuration paths that are difficult to remember

**Impact**: Developers spend 30-60 minutes configuring each MCP server, with high error rates and security risks from misconfigured credentials.

## Objectives

1. **Simplify Discovery**: Provide a centralized registry of available MCP servers with descriptions and categories
2. **Automate Configuration**: Generate correct Claude Code/Desktop configurations automatically
3. **Secure Credentials**: Mask and validate sensitive environment variables
4. **Enable Sharing**: Allow teams to share MCP configurations through DDx templates
5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Work seamlessly across macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Functional Requirements

- Display all available MCP servers from the registry
- Support filtering by category (development, database, filesystem, etc.)
- Support keyword search across names and descriptions
- Show installation status for each server

#### FR-002: Install MCP Server
- Install and configure an MCP server with a single command
- Prompt for required environment variables interactively
- Validate environment variable values before configuration
- Auto-detect Claude Code vs Claude Desktop installation
- Generate appropriate JSON configuration

#### FR-003: Manage Server Configuration
- View current configuration for installed servers
- Update environment variables for existing servers
- Remove server configurations safely with backup
- Check server connection status

#### FR-004: Security Features
- Mask sensitive environment variables in displayed output
- Validate server definitions for security issues
- Prevent path traversal in configuration paths
- Secure storage recommendations for credentials

#### FR-005: CLI Implementation Integration
- Connect CLI command interface to internal implementation logic
- Replace placeholder responses with actual functionality
- Ensure all MCP commands invoke their corresponding internal services
- Provide consistent error handling and user feedback across all commands
- Validate that CLI commands match their documented behavior specifications

### P1 - Important (Post-MVP)

#### FR-006: Template Integration
- Include MCP server configs in project templates
- Variable substitution for project-specific values
- Support for development vs production configurations

#### FR-007: Registry Management
- Support custom MCP server registries
- Cache registry data for offline use
- Version management for server definitions

### P2 - Nice to Have

#### FR-008: Advanced Features
- Bulk installation of multiple servers
- Server dependency management
- Configuration profiles for different environments
- Export/import configuration sets

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Registry search must return results in <100ms
- **NFR-002**: Configuration generation must complete in <1 second
- **NFR-003**: Cache registry data with 15-minute TTL

### Security
- **NFR-004**: Never log or display sensitive environment variables in plaintext
- **NFR-005**: Validate all YAML/JSON inputs against schema
- **NFR-006**: Use secure file permissions (0600) for configuration files
- **NFR-007**: Implement rate limiting for registry API calls

### Usability
- **NFR-008**: Provide helpful error messages with resolution steps
- **NFR-009**: Support --help for all commands with examples
- **NFR-010**: Interactive prompts with sensible defaults
- **NFR-011**: Progress indicators for long-running operations

### Compatibility
- **NFR-012**: Support Claude Code settings format
- **NFR-013**: Support Claude Desktop configuration format
- **NFR-014**: Work on macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+, Windows 10+
- **NFR-015**: Backwards compatibility with existing configurations

### Reliability
- **NFR-016**: Backup existing configurations before modification
- **NFR-017**: Atomic configuration updates (all or nothing)
- **NFR-018**: Graceful handling of missing Claude installations
- **NFR-019**: Rollback capability for failed installations

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Setup
```bash
# Developer wants to add GitHub MCP server
$ ddx mcp list --category development
📋 Development MCP Servers:
  ✅ github - GitHub integration for repository access
  ⬜ gitlab - GitLab integration for repository access
  
$ ddx mcp install github
🔧 Installing GitHub MCP Server...
GitHub Personal Access Token (will be masked): ***
✅ MCP server 'github' installed successfully
📍 Configuration written to: ~/.claude/settings.local.json
```

### Scenario 2: Team Configuration
```bash
# Team lead creates template with MCP servers
$ ddx init backend-api --mcp postgres,redis,github
✅ Project initialized with MCP servers pre-configured
```

### Scenario 3: Configuration Update
```bash
# Update credentials for existing server
$ ddx mcp configure postgres
🔧 Updating PostgreSQL MCP Server...
Current connection string: postgresql://user:***@localhost:5432/db
New connection string (or press Enter to keep): 
✅ Configuration updated
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Multiple Claude Installations**: Detect and prompt user to choose
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Check for npx/npm and provide installation instructions
3. **Corrupted Config Files**: Validate JSON and offer repair/backup options
4. **Network Issues**: Use cached registry data when offline
5. **Permission Errors**: Provide clear instructions for fixing file permissions

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Go YAML parser for server definitions
- JSON manipulation for Claude configurations
- File system operations for config management
- Environment variable handling

### External Dependencies
- MCP server packages (npm-based)
- Claude Code/Desktop installations
- Git for version control integration

## Assumptions

1. Users have npm/npx installed for MCP server execution
2. Claude Code or Desktop is already installed
3. Users have appropriate permissions to modify config files
4. MCP servers follow standard npm package conventions

## Out of Scope

1. Creating new MCP servers (only management of existing ones)
2. Modifying MCP server source code
3. Direct integration with Claude's internal APIs
4. Automatic credential generation or retrieval
5. MCP server debugging or troubleshooting

## Success Metrics

1. **Time to Configure**: Reduce from 30+ minutes to <5 minutes
2. **Error Rate**: <5% failed installations
3. **Security Incidents**: Zero credential exposures
4. **User Adoption**: 50% of DDx users utilize MCP features within 3 months
5. **Registry Growth**: 20+ MCP servers in registry within 6 months

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| MCP API changes | Medium | High | Version lock server definitions, maintain compatibility layer |
| Security breach via malicious server | Low | Critical | Validate all server definitions, security scanning |
| Claude config format changes | Low | High | Abstract configuration layer, version detection |
| Platform compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive testing matrix, platform-specific code |
