# Product Principles

## Purpose
These principles define the core values and guidelines that govern DDx development, ensuring consistent, high-quality tooling for AI-assisted development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation as Code
**Documentation drives development, not the other way around.**
- All features begin with comprehensive documentation
- Documentation is versioned alongside code
- Changes to behavior require documentation updates first
- AI prompts and instructions are first-class citizens

### 2. Workflow Completeness
**Every workflow must be fully specified before implementation.**
- All phases must have clear inputs and outputs
- Ambiguities must be marked and resolved before proceeding
- Phase transitions must be explicit and validated
- No implementation without complete specifications

### 3. Test-Driven Quality
**Tests define the contract before implementation exists.**
- Contract tests specify external behavior
- Integration tests verify component interactions
- Unit tests validate internal logic
- Implementation only begins after tests are failing
- Test coverage is a requirement, not a goal

### 4. Simplicity by Default
**Start minimal, add complexity only when justified.**
- Initial implementations use the fewest possible components
- Additional complexity requires documented justification
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Avoid premature optimization

### 5. Observable Operations
**Every operation must be inspectable and verifiable.**
- All functionality exposes testable interfaces
- No hidden state affecting behavior
- Clear audit trails for all operations
- Diagnostic capabilities built-in from the start

### 6. Continuous Validation
**Validation happens at every step, not just at checkpoints.**
- Input validation at phase boundaries
- Continuous specification consistency checks
- Implementation verified against specifications
- Test quality monitored continuously

### 7. Community-Driven Evolution
**The toolkit grows through shared experience.**
- Templates and patterns are community-contributed
- Production learnings flow back into specifications
- Incidents become test cases
- Success patterns become templates

### 8. AI-First Design
**Built for AI collaboration from the ground up.**
- Clear, structured prompts for AI assistance
- Machine-readable specifications and templates
- Consistent patterns that AI can learn and apply
- Feedback loops that improve AI performance

### 9. Cross-Platform Consistency
**Same experience across all supported platforms.**
- CLI behavior identical on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Templates work regardless of environment
- Configuration portable across systems
- No platform-specific workarounds

### 10. Version Compatibility
**Breaking changes are rare and well-communicated.**
- Backward compatibility by default
- Clear migration paths when breaks necessary
- Semantic versioning strictly followed
- Deprecation warnings before removal

### 11. Functional Completeness
**No stub implementations or placeholder functionality in user-facing commands.**
- CLI commands must execute actual functionality, never mock responses
- TODO comments are prohibited in production code paths
- Stub implementations are engineering debt that misleads users
- If functionality isn't ready, the command shouldn't be exposed
- Success messages must reflect actual completed operations

### 12. Extensibility Through Composition
**Core CLI remains minimal; features are added through library resources.**
- The CLI core provides only fundamental operations: init, update, apply, list
- Tool-specific integrations (Obsidian, VSCode, etc.) belong in library scripts/tools
- Workflow implementations are loaded from library definitions, not hard-coded
- New capabilities are added as templates, prompts, or scripts, not CLI commands
- The CLI is a delivery mechanism, not a feature repository
- Third-party tools integrate through the library, maintaining CLI simplicity

## Application

### In Development
- Every PR must demonstrate principle adherence
- Code reviews check for principle violations
- Templates include principle checklists
- CI/CD enforces principle compliance

### In Documentation
- User guides reference relevant principles
- API documentation links to principles
- Error messages suggest principle-based solutions
- Troubleshooting guides organized by principles

### In Community
- Contributions evaluated against principles
- Discussions reference principles for decisions
- Feature requests mapped to principles
- Success stories highlight principle application

## Enforcement

These principles are enforced through:

1. **Development Gates**
   - Pre-commit hooks validate compliance
   - CI checks enforce standards
   - PR templates include principle checklists
   - Review process includes principle assessment
   - Automated detection of TODO comments in user-facing code paths
   - Stub implementation scanning in CLI command handlers

2. **Tooling Support**
   - Templates embed principle guidance
   - Prompts reference principles
   - Diagnostics check principle adherence
   - Reports highlight principle violations

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Every feature documents principle alignment
   - Exceptions require explicit justification
   - Trade-offs clearly explained
   - Alternatives considered and documented

## Exceptions

When principles must be violated:

1. **Document the Reason**
   - Specific constraint requiring exception
   - Why alternatives don't work
   - Impact on users and maintainers

2. **Define the Scope**
   - Which principle is being excepted
   - How much of the system is affected
   - Duration of the exception

3. **Plan for Resolution**
   - When the exception can be removed
   - What changes enable compliance
   - Migration path back to principles

4. **Track and Review**
   - Exception logged in documentation
   - Regular review of active exceptions
   - Metrics on exception frequency

## Evolution

These principles evolve through:

1. **Community Feedback**
   - User experience reports
   - Contributor suggestions
   - Production learnings

2. **Formal Process**
   - Proposed changes in discussions
   - Impact analysis required
   - Community review period
   - Version bump on acceptance

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - New principles are additive
   - Modifications require migration plan
   - Deprecation follows semantic versioning

## Measurement

Success metrics for principle adherence:

- **Code Quality**: Test coverage, bug rates, complexity metrics
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness, accuracy, clarity scores
- **User Satisfaction**: Support tickets, user feedback, adoption rates
- **Contributor Experience**: PR velocity, contribution quality, retention
- **AI Effectiveness**: Prompt success rates, generation quality, iteration counts
