# User Story: [US-025] - Workflow Author Creating Custom Workflow

**Story ID**: US-025
**Priority**: P1
**Feature**: FEAT-005 - Workflow Execution Engine
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Defined

## Story Description

**As a** workflow author (team lead, architect, or senior developer)
**I want** to create a custom workflow for my team's specific process
**So that** we can standardize and share our best practices across projects and team members

## Business Value

- Enables teams to codify their unique processes
- Reduces knowledge silos by making expertise shareable
- Ensures consistent application of team methodologies
- Allows iterative improvement of team processes

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Phase Definition
- **Given** I am creating a new workflow
- **When** I define workflow phases and their ordering
- **Then** the system validates dependencies and creates a valid workflow structure

### AC-002: Gate Configuration
- **Given** I am defining a workflow phase
- **When** I specify input gates and exit criteria
- **Then** these requirements are enforced during workflow execution

### AC-003: Template Creation
- **Given** I need to generate artifacts in my workflow
- **When** I create artifact templates with variables
- **Then** templates are validated and available for use in workflow phases

### AC-004: Action Definition
- **Given** I need custom operations in my workflow
- **When** I define action prompts for specific tasks
- **Then** actions can be executed consistently across workflow instances

### AC-005: Workflow Testing
- **Given** I have created a workflow
- **When** I test workflow execution in a sample project
- **Then** I can verify all phases work correctly before sharing

### AC-006: Version Management
- **Given** I need to update an existing workflow
- **When** I publish a new version
- **Then** version history is maintained and existing users can update

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Author can define phases with clear ordering
- [ ] Input gates and exit criteria are configurable
- [ ] Templates can be created with variable substitution
- [ ] Action prompts are definable and executable
- [ ] Workflow can be tested before publication
- [ ] Versioning system tracks changes
- [ ] Documentation is generated for the workflow
- [ ] All acceptance criteria have automated tests

## Notes

This story enables the creation of reusable workflows that can be shared within teams and across the community, directly addressing the knowledge sharing problem identified in the PRD.
