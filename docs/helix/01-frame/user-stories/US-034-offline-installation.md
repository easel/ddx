# User Story: US-034 - Offline Installation

**Feature**: FEAT-004 - Cross-Platform Installation
**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a** developer in a restricted network environment
**I want to** install DDX without internet access
**So that** I can use DDX in air-gapped or corporate environments

## Business Value

- Enables adoption in enterprise and secure environments
- Supports developers in restricted network conditions
- Reduces dependency on external network services

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Offline Installer Package
**Given** I need to install DDX offline
**When** I download the offline installer package
**Then** it contains binaries for all supported platforms

### AC-002: Local Installation Execution
**Given** I have the offline installer package
**When** I run the installer script
**Then** DDX installs without requiring network access

### AC-003: Local Binary Specification
**Given** I have a DDX binary file locally
**When** I specify the local path to the installer
**Then** it uses that binary instead of downloading

### AC-004: Offline Verification
**Given** I install DDX offline
**When** installation completes
**Then** verification works without network connectivity

### AC-005: Documentation Included
**Given** I have the offline installer package
**When** I extract it
**Then** it includes complete documentation for offline setup

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Offline installer package available for download
- [ ] Package includes all platform binaries
- [ ] Installation works completely offline
- [ ] Verification runs without network access
- [ ] Complete offline documentation included
- [ ] Package creation process documented

## Notes

- Package should be reasonably sized despite including multiple platforms
- Must include clear instructions for offline environment setup
- Should support creation of custom offline packages
