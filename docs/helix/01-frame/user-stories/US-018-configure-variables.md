# User Story: Configure Persona Bindings

**Story ID**: US-018
**Feature**: FEAT-003 (Configuration Management)
**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-29

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** configure persona bindings for different roles
**So that** I can assign specific AI personalities to workflow roles

## Description
This story enables developers to bind specific persona names to abstract roles in their DDX configuration. This allows workflows to specify required roles (like "code-reviewer" or "test-engineer") while projects can bind their preferred personas to those roles. This provides flexibility and team customization while maintaining workflow portability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** `.ddx/config.yaml`, **when** persona_bindings defined, **then** role-to-persona mappings are supported
- [ ] **Given** persona bindings, **when** workflows execute, **then** correct personas are loaded for each role
- [ ] **Given** missing persona bindings, **when** roles required, **then** clear error messages indicate which bindings are needed
- [ ] **Given** invalid persona names, **when** bindings specified, **then** validation ensures personas exist in library
- [ ] **Given** configuration changes, **when** persona bindings updated, **then** new bindings take effect immediately

## Business Value
- Enables team customization of AI interactions
- Maintains workflow portability across projects
- Provides clear role-based abstraction
- Supports consistent AI behavior patterns
- Facilitates sharing of proven persona configurations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Persona binding configuration format is implemented
- [ ] Persona validation ensures referenced personas exist
- [ ] Configuration loading includes persona_bindings section
- [ ] Workflows can resolve bound personas by role
- [ ] Error messages clearly indicate missing or invalid bindings
- [ ] Unit tests cover all persona binding scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify persona loading in workflows
- [ ] Documentation includes persona binding examples
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## Technical Considerations
To be defined in technical design
- Persona existence validation at configuration load time
- Performance of persona lookup during workflow execution
- Caching of persona content for repeated access

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: US-017 (Initialize Configuration) must be completed
- **Related**: Used by workflow execution features (US-042)

## Assumptions
- Persona names follow consistent naming conventions
- Personas exist in the library before being referenced
- Role names are defined by workflows, not arbitrary

## Edge Cases
- Missing persona files referenced in bindings
- Invalid YAML in persona binding configuration
- Role names with special characters
- Empty or null persona bindings

## Examples

### Basic Persona Bindings
```yaml
version: "1.0"
library:
  path: "./library"
  repository:
    url: "https://github.com/easel/ddx"
    branch: "main"
    subtree: "library"
persona_bindings:
  code-reviewer: "strict-code-reviewer"
  test-engineer: "tdd-test-engineer"
  documentation-writer: "technical-writer"
```

### Minimal Configuration
```yaml
version: "1.0"
persona_bindings:
  code-reviewer: "basic-reviewer"
```

## User Feedback
*To be collected during implementation and testing*

## Notes
- Persona bindings provide team customization while maintaining workflow portability
- Should validate persona existence to prevent runtime errors
- Consider providing helpful suggestions when personas are not found
