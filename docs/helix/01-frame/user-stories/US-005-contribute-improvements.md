**Story ID**: US-005
**Feature**: FEAT-001 - Core CLI Framework
**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Future
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to share my improvements back to the community
**So that** others can benefit from my enhancements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** I have improvements to share, **when** I run `ddx contribute`, **then** the contribution workflow is initiated with clear steps
- [ ] **Given** I'm contributing an asset, **when** the process starts, **then** asset quality and format are validated against standards
- [ ] **Given** validation passes, **when** I contribute, **then** a pull request is created to the master repository
- [ ] **Given** contribution guidelines exist, **when** I contribute, **then** my submission is checked against these guidelines
- [ ] **Given** authentication is required, **when** I contribute, **then** git handles authentication seamlessly
- [ ] **Given** I've initiated contribution, **when** I check status, **then** I can see the current state of my contribution
- [ ] **Given** I have multiple improvements, **when** I run `ddx contribute <asset>`, **then** I can contribute specific assets selectively
- [ ] **Given** I'm contributing, **when** the PR is created, **then** metadata (author, description, rationale) is included

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Contribute command implemented with workflow
- [ ] Asset validation against quality standards
- [ ] Pull request creation automated
- [ ] Guidelines checking integrated
- [ ] Status tracking implemented
- [ ] Selective contribution working
- [ ] Metadata collection and inclusion
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for contribution flow
- [ ] Documentation updated with contribution guide

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Considerations
- Must integrate with git and GitHub/GitLab APIs
- Should validate asset structure and documentation
- Need to handle different contribution types (new vs. update)
- Consider requiring tests for code contributions
- Should check for breaking changes

### Error Scenarios
- Not authenticated with remote repository
- Asset fails quality validation
- Network issues during PR creation
- Contribution conflicts with existing PR
- Missing required metadata
- Repository permissions insufficient

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Contribution
1. Create or improve an asset
2. Run `ddx contribute`
3. Follow prompts to describe contribution
4. **Expected**: PR created with asset and description

### Scenario 2: Failed Validation
1. Create asset with poor documentation
2. Run `ddx contribute`
3. **Expected**: Validation fails with specific feedback on what to fix

### Scenario 3: Selective Contribution
1. Modify multiple assets
2. Run `ddx contribute templates/my-template`
3. **Expected**: Only specified template is included in PR

### Scenario 4: Update Existing Asset
1. Improve an existing community asset
2. Run `ddx contribute`
3. **Expected**: PR shows diff of improvements with clear description

## User Persona

### Primary: Active Contributor
- **Role**: Developer who improves and shares solutions
- **Goals**: Give back to community, establish reputation
- **Pain Points**: Complex contribution process, unclear standards
- **Technical Level**: Intermediate to advanced

### Secondary: First-Time Contributor
- **Role**: Developer making first contribution
- **Goals**: Share a useful solution they've created
- **Pain Points**: Intimidating process, fear of rejection
- **Technical Level**: Beginner to intermediate

## Dependencies

- DDX must be initialized
- Git must be configured with user identity
- Authentication to remote repository
- Network connectivity
- Asset must pass validation checks
