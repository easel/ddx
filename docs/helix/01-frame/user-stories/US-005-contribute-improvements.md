## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to share my improvements back to the community
**So that** others can benefit from my enhancements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** I have improvements to share, **when** I run `ddx contribute`, **then** the contribution workflow is initiated with clear steps
- [ ] **Given** I'm contributing changes, **when** the system packages them, **then** changes are formatted appropriately for submission
- [ ] **Given** my contribution is ready, **when** validation runs, **then** the system checks that it meets contribution standards
- [ ] **Given** validation passes, **when** I submit, **then** the contribution is sent to the upstream repository
- [ ] **Given** submission is complete, **when** I check status, **then** I see clear submission status and next steps
- [ ] **Given** I'm contributing, **when** I need guidance, **then** contribution guidelines are readily available
- [ ] **Given** authentication is required, **when** I contribute, **then** credentials are handled securely
- [ ] **Given** I have multiple improvements, **when** I run `ddx contribute <asset>`, **then** I can contribute specific assets selectively

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Contribution
1. Create or improve an asset
2. Run `ddx contribute`
3. Follow prompts to describe contribution
4. **Expected**: Contribution submitted successfully with PR/MR created

### Scenario 2: Validation Failure

2. Attempt to contribute
3. **Expected**: Clear validation errors with specific feedback on what to fix

### Scenario 3: Selective Contribution
1. Modify multiple assets
2. Run `ddx contribute templates/my-template`
3. **Expected**: Only specified template is included in submission

### Scenario 4: Multi-file Contribution
1. Modify multiple related resources
2. Run `ddx contribute`
3. **Expected**: All related changes packaged together

## User Persona

### Primary: Open Source Contributor
- **Role**: Active community member

## Dependencies

- DDX must be initialized
- Git must be configured with user identity
- Authentication to remote repository
- Network connectivity
- Asset must pass validation checks
- **FEAT-002**: Git subtree primitives for push operations (internal/git/git.go)

## Related Stories

- US-007: Configure DDX Settings (for contributor info)
- US-016: Manage Authentication (for secure submission)

## Success Metrics

- Time from change to submission < 5 minutes
- Validation catches 95% of issues before submission
- Successful submission rate > 90%
- Clear error messages for failures

## Contribution Guidelines Integration

The system should automatically:
- Check for CONTRIBUTING.md
- Validate against .ddx-contribution rules
- Format commits according to standards
- Generate PR/MR descriptions
- Include required metadata
