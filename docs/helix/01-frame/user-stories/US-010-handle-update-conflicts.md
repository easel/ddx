# User Story: US-010 - Handle Update Conflicts

**Story ID**: US-010
**Feature**: FEAT-002 - Upstream Synchronization System
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story

**As a** developer with local customizations
**I want** to resolve conflicts when updates clash with my local changes
**So that** I can integrate updates without losing my customizations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** a conflict exists between local and upstream changes, **when** I run update, **then** conflicting files and specific changes are clearly identified
- [ ] **Given** conflicts are detected, **when** I view the conflict report, **then** I receive actionable guidance on how to resolve them
- [ ] **Given** a conflict exists, **when** I request comparison, **then** I can see both local and upstream versions side-by-side
- [ ] **Given** I want to abandon the update, **when** I run `ddx update --abort`, **then** the system reverts to the state before update started
- [ ] **Given** I prefer upstream changes, **when** I run `ddx update --theirs`, **then** upstream changes are applied for all conflicts
- [ ] **Given** I prefer my local changes, **when** I run `ddx update --mine`, **then** local changes are kept for all conflicts
- [ ] **Given** I've resolved conflicts manually, **when** I mark resolution complete, **then** the system validates the resolution before proceeding
- [ ] **Given** complex conflicts exist, **when** manual resolution is needed, **then** the system preserves conflict markers for manual editing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Conflict detection algorithm implemented
- [ ] Clear conflict reporting with file paths and line numbers
- [ ] Resolution strategies implemented (abort, theirs, mine)
- [ ] Interactive conflict resolution interface
- [ ] Validation of resolved conflicts
- [ ] Unit tests for conflict scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests for resolution strategies
- [ ] Documentation with conflict resolution examples
- [ ] Help text and guidance messages
- [ ] Recovery mechanism for failed resolutions

## Technical Notes

### Conflict Types to Handle
- Text file conflicts (line-by-line)
- Binary file conflicts
- Deleted vs modified conflicts
- Added with different content
- Directory structure conflicts

### Resolution Strategies
1. **Automatic** (when possible)
2. **Interactive** (user chooses per conflict)
3. **Batch** (apply same strategy to all)
4. **Manual** (edit conflict markers)

### User Experience
- Clear, non-technical error messages
- Progress indication during resolution
- Ability to pause and resume resolution
- Preview of resolution results

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Text Conflict
1. Modify a template file locally
2. Pull update that modifies the same lines
3. Run update and choose resolution strategy
4. **Expected**: Conflict resolved according to chosen strategy

### Scenario 2: Abort During Conflict
1. Start update that causes conflicts
2. Run `ddx update --abort`
3. **Expected**: System returns to pre-update state

### Scenario 3: Mixed Resolution
1. Have multiple conflicts
2. Resolve some with --mine, some with --theirs
3. **Expected**: Each conflict resolved according to selection

### Scenario 4: Binary File Conflict
1. Modify a binary file (e.g., image) locally
2. Pull update with different binary
3. **Expected**: Clear choice between versions, no merge attempt

## User Persona

### Primary: Team Lead Developer
- **Role**: Senior developer managing team standards
- **Goals**: Maintain team customizations while adopting improvements
- **Pain Points**: Lost work from bad merges, unclear conflict messages
- **Technical Level**: Expert with version control concepts

### Secondary: Junior Developer
- **Role**: New team member learning the codebase
- **Goals**: Get updates without breaking their setup
- **Pain Points**: Intimidating conflict resolution, fear of breaking things
- **Technical Level**: Basic understanding of version control

## Dependencies

- US-009: Pull Updates from Upstream (conflicts occur during updates)
- US-013: Rollback Problematic Updates (for recovery)

## Related Stories

- US-009: Pull Updates from Upstream
- US-013: Rollback Problematic Updates

## Risk Mitigation

- Always create backup before conflict resolution
- Provide clear rollback instructions
- Validate file integrity after resolution
- Log all resolution decisions for audit
