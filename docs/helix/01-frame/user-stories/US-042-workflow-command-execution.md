# User Story: [US-042] - Workflow Command Execution

**Story ID**: US-042
**Priority**: P0
**Feature**: FEAT-005 - Workflow Execution Engine
**Created**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: Defined

## Story Description

**As a** developer using DDx workflows
**I want** to discover and execute workflow-specific commands
**So that** I can leverage workflow automation for complex development tasks like working on user stories

## Business Value

- Enables workflow-driven development with AI assistance
- Provides discoverable workflow capabilities
- Reduces time from task identification to execution
- Enables consistent application of workflow methodologies

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Command Discovery
- **Given** I have the HELIX workflow available
- **When** I run `ddx workflow helix commands`
- **Then** I see a list of available commands with descriptions

### AC-002: Command Execution
- **Given** I have a workflow with commands available
- **When** I run `ddx workflow helix execute build-story US-001`
- **Then** The build-story command prompt is loaded and displayed

### AC-003: Error Handling - Invalid Workflow
- **Given** I specify a non-existent workflow
- **When** I run `ddx workflow invalid commands`
- **Then** I receive an error message about the workflow not being found

### AC-004: Error Handling - Invalid Command
- **Given** I specify a non-existent command
- **When** I run `ddx workflow helix execute invalid-command`
- **Then** I receive an error about the command not being found

### AC-005: Command Arguments
- **Given** A command requires arguments
- **When** I execute it with arguments like `ddx workflow helix execute build-story US-001`
- **Then** The arguments are passed to the command context

### AC-006: Multiple Workflow Support
- **Given** Multiple workflows are available
- **When** I run commands for different workflows
- **Then** Each workflow's commands are correctly isolated and executed

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User can list commands for any workflow using `ddx workflow <name> commands`
- [ ] User can execute workflow commands with arguments using `ddx workflow <name> execute <command> [args]`
- [ ] Commands are loaded from `library/workflows/<name>/commands/` directory
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Command discovery works for any workflow with a commands directory
- [ ] All acceptance criteria have passing tests
- [ ] Integration with existing workflow system maintains backward compatibility

## Technical Notes

This story implements the foundation for workflow-specific command execution as referenced in CLAUDE.md:
- `ddx workflow helix execute build-story US-001`
- `ddx workflow helix execute continue`
- `ddx workflow helix commands`

The implementation should discover commands dynamically from the library structure rather than hardcoding them.
