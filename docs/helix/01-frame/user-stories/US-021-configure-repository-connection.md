# User Story: Configure Repository Connection

**Story ID**: US-021
**Feature**: FEAT-003 (Configuration Management)
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** configure the master repository connection
**So that** I can sync with the correct source

## Description
This story enables developers to configure how DDX connects to the master repository containing templates, patterns, and other resources. Different teams may use different DDX repositories, different branches, or have specific networking requirements. This configuration ensures DDX pulls from the appropriate source.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** config file, **when** repository URL specified, **then** connection uses that URL
- [ ] **Given** repository config, **when** branch specified, **then** that branch is tracked
- [ ] **Given** sync settings, **when** configured, **then** frequency preferences are honored
- [ ] **Given** authentication needs, **when** required, **then** auth method is configurable
- [ ] **Given** multiple sources, **when** needed, **then** multiple remotes are supported
- [ ] **Given** network restrictions, **when** present, **then** proxy configuration works
- [ ] **Given** protocol preference, **when** set, **then** SSH vs HTTPS is respected
- [ ] **Given** remote naming, **when** customized, **then** custom names are used

## Business Value
- Enables organizations to use private DDX repositories
- Supports different branches for different environments
- Accommodates various network and security requirements
- Allows testing with development versions of DDX resources
- Enables enterprise deployment scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Repository URL configuration is implemented
- [ ] Branch specification works correctly
- [ ] Sync frequency settings are functional
- [ ] Authentication configuration is supported
- [ ] Multiple remote repository support works
- [ ] Proxy configuration is implemented
- [ ] Protocol selection (SSH/HTTPS) works
- [ ] Custom remote naming is supported
- [ ] Unit tests cover all configuration scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify repository connections
- [ ] Documentation explains all repository options
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## Technical Considerations
To be defined in technical design
- Git integration for repository operations
- Authentication credential storage and security
- Network timeout and retry mechanisms
- Repository validation and health checks

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: US-017 (Initialize Configuration) must be completed
- **Related**: FEAT-002 (Upstream Synchronization) uses this configuration

## Assumptions
- Git is available in the environment
- Network access is available for repository operations
- Private repositories are supported via git authentication
- Authentication uses Git's native SSH/HTTPS methods

## Edge Cases
- Invalid repository URL format
- Repository does not exist or is inaccessible
- Network connectivity issues during sync
- Authentication failures
- Branch does not exist in remote repository
- Proxy authentication required
- SSL certificate issues
- Very large repositories affecting performance

## Examples

### Basic Repository Configuration
```yaml
repository:
  url: "https://github.com/company/ddx-resources"
  branch: "main"
  remote: "ddx-master"
```

### Advanced Configuration
```yaml
repository:
  url: "git@github.com:company/ddx-private.git"
  branch: "development"
  remote: "company-ddx"
  protocol: "ssh"

  # Authentication
  auth:
    method: "ssh-key"
    key_path: "~/.ssh/ddx_deploy_key"

  # Network settings
  proxy:
    url: "http://proxy.company.com:8080"
    auth: "user:pass"

  # Sync behavior
  sync:
    frequency: "daily"
    auto_update: true
    timeout: 30
```

### Multiple Repositories
```yaml
repositories:
  primary:
    url: "https://github.com/ddx/ddx-official"
    branch: "main"
    priority: 1

  company:
    url: "https://github.com/company/ddx-internal"
    branch: "company-main"
    priority: 2
```

## Connection Testing
```bash
# Test repository connection
ddx config test-connection

# Show current repository status
ddx config repository status

# Switch to different branch
ddx config repository branch dev-branch
```

## User Feedback
*To be collected during implementation and testing*

## Notes
- Repository configuration is foundational for DDX synchronization
- Must handle various enterprise security requirements
- Consider supporting repository mirrors for reliability
- May need sophisticated error handling and recovery
