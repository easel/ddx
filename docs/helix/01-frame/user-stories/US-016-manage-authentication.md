# User Story: US-016 - Manage Authentication

**Story ID**: US-016
**Feature**: FEAT-002 - Upstream Synchronization System
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story

**As a** developer accessing protected upstream repositories
**I want** to manage authentication credentials securely
**So that** I can access the upstream repository and submit contributions without exposing credentials

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Given** system credential stores exist, **when** authenticating, **then** existing credential stores are used when available
- [ ] **Given** I use SSH, **when** configuring authentication, **then** SSH key authentication is fully supported
- [ ] **Given** I use HTTPS, **when** authenticating, **then** token-based authentication works securely
- [ ] **Given** credential helpers exist, **when** DDX needs auth, **then** it integrates with system credential helpers
- [ ] **Given** I provide credentials, **when** stored, **then** no plaintext passwords are ever stored
- [ ] **Given** authentication fails, **when** I see errors, **then** clear, actionable error messages are displayed
- [ ] **Given** 2FA is required, **when** authenticating, **then** two-factor authentication workflows are supported
- [ ] **Given** I'm about to operate, **when** auth is needed, **then** credentials are validated before operations begin

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Multiple authentication methods implemented
- [ ] Secure credential storage integration
- [ ] SSH key support complete
- [ ] Token management working
- [ ] 2FA workflow implemented
- [ ] Credential validation before operations
- [ ] Unit tests for auth flows
- [ ] Integration tests with platforms
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation for setup

## Technical Notes

### Authentication Methods
1. **SSH Keys**: Use existing SSH agent
2. **HTTPS Tokens**: Personal access tokens
3. **OAuth**: OAuth2 flow for web-based auth
4. **Credential Helpers**: Git credential helpers

### Security Requirements
- Never store plaintext passwords
- Use OS keychain when available
- Support encrypted credential files
- Clear credentials from memory after use
- Audit log for auth attempts
- Rate limiting for failed attempts

### Platform-Specific Auth
- **GitHub**: Personal access tokens, SSH, OAuth
- **GitLab**: Personal/project tokens, SSH
- **Bitbucket**: App passwords, SSH keys
- **Generic Git**: Basic auth, SSH

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: SSH Key Setup
1. Configure SSH key authentication
2. Test connection to upstream
3. **Expected**: Successful authentication via SSH

### Scenario 2: Token Authentication
1. Generate personal access token
2. Configure DDX to use token
3. **Expected**: Secure token storage and usage

### Scenario 3: 2FA Challenge
1. Attempt operation requiring 2FA
2. Complete 2FA challenge
3. **Expected**: Operation proceeds after 2FA

### Scenario 4: Credential Rotation
1. Update expired credentials
2. Test with new credentials
3. **Expected**: Seamless transition to new creds

## User Persona

### Primary: Security-Conscious Developer
- **Role**: Developer in enterprise environment
- **Goals**: Secure access without credential exposure
- **Pain Points**: Complex auth setup, credential management
- **Technical Level**: Intermediate to expert

### Secondary: Open Source Maintainer
- **Role**: Managing multiple repositories
- **Goals**: Easy auth across multiple projects
- **Pain Points**: Managing many credentials, different platform requirements
- **Technical Level**: Expert

## Dependencies

- Platform APIs for authentication
- OS keychain/credential systems

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
- Credential theft from disk
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Credential replay attacks
- Social engineering

### Mitigations
- Encrypted storage only
- Certificate pinning for HTTPS
- Time-limited tokens
- User education in docs

## Error Messages

Provide clear guidance for common issues:
- "Authentication failed: Invalid token. Please check your personal access token has the required scopes: repo, write"
- "SSH key not found. Please ensure your SSH key is added to the SSH agent: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
- "2FA required. Please complete two-factor authentication to continue."
