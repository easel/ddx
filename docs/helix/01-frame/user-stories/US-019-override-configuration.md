# User Story: Override Configuration

**Story ID**: US-019
**Feature**: FEAT-003 (Configuration Management)
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Story
**As a** developer
**I want to** override configuration for specific environments
**So that** I can have different settings for dev/staging/prod

## Description
This story provides the ability to override base configuration settings for different environments. Developers often need different configurations for development, staging, and production environments. This feature allows them to maintain a base configuration while selectively overriding specific values for each environment without duplicating the entire configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** environment configs, **when** present, **then** `.ddx.dev.yml`, `.ddx.staging.yml` are supported
- [ ] **Given** `DDX_ENV` variable, **when** set, **then** appropriate override file is selected
- [ ] **Given** overrides, **when** loaded, **then** they merge correctly with base configuration
- [ ] **Given** any config value, **when** overridden, **then** override takes precedence
- [ ] **Given** command-line flags, **when** provided, **then** they override all file configs
- [ ] **Given** merged config, **when** requested, **then** effective configuration is displayed
- [ ] **Given** override values, **when** loaded, **then** compatibility is validated
- [ ] **Given** partial configs, **when** used as overrides, **then** only specified values are changed

## Business Value
- Enables single codebase for multiple environments
- Reduces configuration errors during deployments
- Simplifies environment-specific customization
- Maintains configuration consistency with controlled variations
- Supports standard DevOps practices

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Environment-specific config file loading is implemented
- [ ] DDX_ENV environment variable detection works
- [ ] Configuration merging algorithm is functional
- [ ] Override precedence order is correct
- [ ] Command-line flag overrides work
- [ ] Effective configuration display is implemented
- [ ] Compatibility validation is in place
- [ ] Partial override support is working
- [ ] Unit tests cover all merge scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify environment switching
- [ ] Documentation explains override mechanisms
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## Technical Considerations
To be defined in technical design
- Merge strategy for nested configurations
- Precedence order documentation
- Performance impact of multiple file loads
- Validation of override compatibility

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite**: US-017 (Initialize Configuration) must be completed
- **Related**: Works with US-024 (View Effective Configuration) for debugging

## Assumptions
- Environment names follow standard conventions (dev, staging, prod)
- Override files are in the same directory as base configuration
- Custom environment names are supported via configuration
- Override merging supports up to 3 levels deep

## Edge Cases
- Missing environment override file when DDX_ENV is set
- Conflicting data types in overrides
- Circular references between base and override
- Invalid override file syntax
- Multiple override files for same environment
- Empty override files
- Override files larger than base configuration

## Examples

### Base Configuration (.ddx.yml)
```yaml
variables:
  api_url: "http://localhost:3000"
  log_level: "info"
  cache_enabled: false
```

### Development Override (.ddx.dev.yml)
```yaml
variables:
  log_level: "debug"
  cache_enabled: false
```

### Production Override (.ddx.prod.yml)
```yaml
variables:
  api_url: "https://api.production.com"
  log_level: "error"
  cache_enabled: true
```

### Usage
```bash
# Use development configuration
DDX_ENV=dev ddx apply template

# Use production configuration
DDX_ENV=prod ddx apply template

# Override with command-line flag
ddx apply template --var api_url=https://custom.api.com
```

## Precedence Order
1. Command-line flags (highest priority)
2. Environment-specific override file
3. Base configuration file
4. Default values (lowest priority)

## User Feedback
*To be collected during implementation and testing*

## Notes
- Override mechanism is critical for real-world deployments
- Should be simple to understand and predict behavior
- Consider providing merge strategy options (replace vs deep merge)
- May need special handling for arrays and complex structures
