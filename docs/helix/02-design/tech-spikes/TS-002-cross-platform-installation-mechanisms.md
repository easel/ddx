# Tech Spike: Cross-Platform Installation Mechanisms

**Spike ID**: TS-002
**Related Features**: FEAT-004
**Time Box**: 2 days
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14

## Context

FEAT-004 solution design assumes we can achieve >99% installation success rate across macOS, Linux, and Windows with automated PATH configuration. We need to validate the technical approach and identify platform-specific challenges before implementation.

## Technical Question

**Primary**: Can we achieve >99% installation success rate with automated PATH configuration across macOS 10.15+, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+), and Windows 10+ using shell scripts?

**Specific Sub-Questions**:
1. What are the platform-specific installation directory conventions?
2. How reliable is automatic shell profile detection and modification?
3. What are the failure modes for PATH configuration across different shells?
4. Can we detect and handle corporate/restricted environments?
5. What fallback mechanisms are needed when automation fails?

## Success Criteria

By the end of this spike, we must have:
- [ ] Working installation scripts for all target platforms
- [ ] Shell profile detection reliability analysis
- [ ] Failure mode catalog with recovery strategies
- [ ] Corporate environment compatibility assessment
- [ ] Installation success rate projection with evidence

## Investigation Scope

### In Scope
- Shell script installation across macOS, Linux, Windows
- PATH configuration for bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell
- Platform-specific installation directory conventions
- Corporate environment restrictions and workarounds
- Fallback strategies for failed automation

### Out of Scope
- GUI installer development
- Package manager integration (separate investigation)
- Code signing and notarization processes
- Container-based installation methods

## Investigation Plan

### Day 1: Platform Research and Prototyping
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Research installation conventions per platform:
  - macOS: `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, Homebrew paths
  - Linux: `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, distribution-specific paths
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\bin`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`
- Create basic installation script prototypes
- Test platform detection logic

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Implement shell detection for major shells:
  - bash (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`)
  - zsh (`.zshrc`)
  - fish (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`)
  - PowerShell (`$PROFILE`)
- Test PATH modification across different shell configurations
- Document platform-specific quirks and edge cases

### Day 2: Testing and Failure Analysis
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Test installation scripts on clean VM environments:
  - macOS 10.15, 11, 12, 13
  - Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04
  - Windows 10, 11
- Test with various shell configurations and edge cases
- Document all failure modes encountered

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Test corporate environment scenarios:
  - Restricted file system permissions
  - Corporate proxies and firewalls
  - Non-standard shell configurations
  - Execution policy restrictions
- Implement and test fallback mechanisms
- Calculate success rate projections based on test results

## Investigation Methodology

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Platform test matrix
Platforms:
- macOS 10.15 (VM)
- macOS 12 (VM)
- Ubuntu 18.04 (Docker)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Docker)
- Ubuntu 22.04 (Docker)
- Windows 10 (VM)
- Windows 11 (VM)

# Shell configurations to test
Shells:
- bash (default, custom .bashrc)
- zsh (oh-my-zsh, custom config)
- fish (default, custom config)
- PowerShell (5.1, 7.x)
```

### Installation Script Structure
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# DDX Installation Script Prototype

set -euo pipefail

# Platform detection
detect_platform() {
    case "$(uname -s)" in
        Darwin) echo "macos" ;;
        Linux)  echo "linux" ;;
        MINGW*|CYGWIN*) echo "windows" ;;
        *) echo "unsupported" && exit 1 ;;
    esac
}

# Installation directory selection
get_install_dir() {
    local platform="$1"
    case "$platform" in
        macos|linux)
            if [[ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ]]; then
                echo "$HOME/.local/bin"
            else
                echo "$HOME/bin"
            fi
            ;;
        windows)
            echo "$USERPROFILE/bin"
            ;;
    esac
}

# Shell profile detection
detect_shell_profile() {
    # Implementation to test various shell profile detection strategies
}

# PATH modification with backup
modify_path() {
    local install_dir="$1"
    local profile_file="$2"

    # Create backup
    cp "$profile_file" "${profile_file}.ddx-backup"

    # Add to PATH if not already present
    if ! grep -q "$install_dir" "$profile_file"; then
        echo 'export PATH="'$install_dir':$PATH"' >> "$profile_file"
    fi
}
```

### Test Scenarios

#### Success Cases
- Default shell configurations
- Standard user permissions
- Clean PATH environments
- Standard installation directories

#### Edge Cases
- Non-existent shell profile files
- Read-only file systems
- Existing PATH conflicts
- Multiple shell configurations
- Symlinked directories

#### Failure Cases
- Insufficient permissions
- Corrupted shell profiles
- Network connectivity issues
- Corporate policy restrictions
- Antivirus interference

### Corporate Environment Testing
```bash
# Corporate restrictions to simulate
- Execution policy restrictions (PowerShell)
- Limited file system permissions
- Proxy authentication requirements
- Software installation restrictions
- Custom PATH configurations
- Non-standard home directories
```

## Expected Findings

### Hypotheses to Test
1. **Shell Detection**: Can reliably detect shell profiles in >95% of standard configurations
2. **PATH Modification**: Safe PATH modification possible with backup/restore mechanism
3. **Platform Variations**: Major differences in installation conventions between platforms
4. **Corporate Restrictions**: 10-15% of corporate environments have restrictions requiring fallbacks
5. **Error Recovery**: Most failures are recoverable with clear user guidance

### Potential Challenges
- PowerShell execution policies on Windows
- Corporate antivirus false positives
- Non-standard shell configurations (custom prompts, etc.)
- Network proxy configurations
- File system permission variations
- Multiple concurrent shell sessions

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Shell profile corruption | Low | High | Automatic backup before modification |
| Corporate policy blocking | Medium | Medium | Clear fallback instructions |
| Platform detection failure | Low | Medium | Manual override options |
| PATH conflicts with existing tools | Medium | Low | PATH prepend instead of append |

- Create additional tech spikes for specific platform issues
- Develop platform-specific installation variants
- Create detailed troubleshooting documentation
- Adjust success rate targets based on evidence
