# ADR-001: Workflow Structure and Template-Prompt-Pattern Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: DDX Architecture Team
**Related Feature(s)**: Cross-cutting - Core Architecture
**Confidence Level**: High

## Context

During the development of DDX (Document-Driven Development eXperience), we needed to design a system that would support AI-assisted development while maintaining flexibility for manual workflows. The architecture must enable reusability, progressive enhancement, and community knowledge sharing.

### Problem Statement

How do we structure DDX workflows to maximize both AI assistant effectiveness and human usability while maintaining separation of concerns and enabling community contribution?

### Current State

Before this decision, workflows in development tools typically mix structure, instructions, and methodology in single documents, creating maintenance challenges and limiting reusability. Templates become bloated with instructions, AI prompts are cluttered with structural concerns, and documentation is hard to maintain.

### Requirements Driving This Decision
- Workflows must work both with AI assistants and for manual completion
- Components should be independently useful and composable
- Structure should be intuitive for developers from different backgrounds
- System should scale from individual use to enterprise adoption
- Architecture should support community contributions and sharing
- Must integrate with existing development tools and processes
- Should leverage standard formats (Markdown, YAML) for broad compatibility

## Decision

We will adopt a three-layer workflow architecture consisting of Templates (structure), Prompts (intelligence), and Patterns (methodology) to provide separation of concerns while maintaining integration.

### Key Points
- **Templates** define pure structure without implementation details (WHAT to create)
- **Prompts** add intelligence and guidance for completion (HOW to create)
- **Patterns** provide methodology and context (WHY and WHEN to use)
- Each layer can function independently or together
- Clear separation enables reusability and composability
- Standard formats (Markdown, YAML) for all components

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Monolithic Documents
**Description**: Combine structure, instructions, and methodology in single documents

**Pros**:
- Single file to manage
- No cross-references needed
- Simpler initial setup
- Everything in one place

**Cons**:
- Hard to maintain and update
- Poor reusability across projects
- Overwhelming for beginners
- AI confusion between structure and content
- Version control conflicts

**Evaluation**: Rejected due to maintenance burden and poor separation of concerns

### Option 2: Pure AI Prompts
**Description**: Make everything AI-specific prompts without separate templates

**Pros**:
- Optimized for AI usage
- Single point of maintenance
- Rich context for generation
- Powerful capabilities

**Cons**:
- Not usable without AI assistance
- Hard to version control
- Limited customization
- No manual fallback
- Vendor lock-in risk

**Evaluation**: Rejected because it excludes non-AI workflows and creates dependency

### Option 3: Three-Layer Architecture (Selected)
**Description**: Separate templates (structure), prompts (intelligence), and patterns (methodology)

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Maximum reusability
- Progressive enhancement support
- Works with and without AI
- Composable components
- Independent evolution of layers

**Cons**:
- More files to manage - mitigated by tooling
- Initial learning curve - addressed with documentation
- Potential inconsistency - solved with validation

**Evaluation**: Selected for optimal balance of flexibility, maintainability, and usability

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Flexibility**: Components can be used independently or combined
- **Reusability**: Templates and prompts can be shared across workflows
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth from individual to enterprise use
- **AI Optimization**: Clear structure improves AI output quality
- **Human Usability**: Templates remain fillable without AI assistance
- **Community Contribution**: Clear boundaries make contribution easier

### Negative Consequences
- **File Proliferation**: Three files minimum per workflow component
- **Learning Curve**: Users must understand the three-layer concept
- **Coordination Overhead**: Keeping layers synchronized requires discipline
- **Initial Complexity**: Higher upfront investment than simpler approaches

### Neutral Consequences
- **Directory Structure**: More complex project organization
- **Documentation Needs**: Requires clear explanation of architecture
- **Tooling Requirements**: Benefits from CLI support but not mandatory

## Implementation Impact

### Development Impact
- **Effort**: Medium - Requires establishing patterns and examples
- **Time**: 2-3 weeks for initial implementation
- **Skills Required**: Understanding of template systems, AI prompting, documentation

### Operational Impact
- **Performance**: Minimal - file-based system with no runtime overhead
- **Scalability**: Excellent - distributed architecture with no central bottleneck
- **Maintenance**: Moderate - requires governance for quality and consistency

### Security Impact
- Templates may contain placeholders that need sanitization
- Prompts must be reviewed for potential injection risks
- No execution of arbitrary code in patterns

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Layer inconsistency | Medium | Medium | Automated validation and testing |
| User confusion | Medium | Low | Clear documentation and examples |
| Adoption resistance | Low | Medium | Progressive disclosure and good defaults |
| Quality variance | Medium | Medium | Review process and quality gates |

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Markdown processing capabilities
- YAML parsing for metadata
- Template engine for variable substitution

### Decision Dependencies
- File structure conventions must be established
- Variable substitution syntax must be defined
- Validation rules must be specified

## Validation

### How We'll Know This Was Right
- Workflow creation time reduced by 50%
- Component reuse rate exceeds 60%
- User satisfaction scores > 4/5
- Community contributions grow monthly
- AI output quality improves measurably

### Review Triggers
This decision should be reviewed if:
- Alternative architectures prove superior in practice
- AI capabilities fundamentally change
- Community feedback indicates structural issues
- Performance problems emerge at scale
