# ADR-010: AI Integration Architecture via CLI Agents

**Date**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: DDX Development Team
**Related Feature(s)**: AI-Assisted Development Workflow
**Confidence Level**: High

## Context

DDX is designed to enable AI-assisted development through structured templates, prompts, and patterns. We need to define how DDX integrates with AI capabilities while maintaining vendor neutrality, simplicity, and focus on our core competencies.

### Problem Statement

How should DDX integrate with AI capabilities to maximize developer productivity while avoiding vendor lock-in, minimizing complexity, and maintaining our focus on structured workflow templates rather than becoming an AI platform ourselves?

### Current State

AI-assisted development is primarily delivered through CLI agents like Claude Code, which provide context-aware assistance, code generation, and workflow automation. These agents are designed to work with existing development tools and file structures.

### Requirements Driving This Decision
- Enable AI-assisted completion of DDX workflows
- Maintain vendor neutrality across AI providers
- Avoid complex API key management and authentication
- Leverage existing AI agent capabilities rather than reinventing
- Keep DDX focused on templates and structured workflows
- Support future direct integration without architectural changes
- Work offline for core DDX functionality

## Decision

We will design DDX for **indirect AI integration via CLI agents** (like Claude Code) rather than direct LLM API integration, using structured templates and prompts that AI agents can consume effectively.

### Key Points
- **Primary Integration**: CLI agents consume DDX templates and prompts
- **Architecture**: Template/prompt-based collaboration model
- **Direct LLM APIs**: Explicitly deferred to future consideration
- **Vendor Neutrality**: No specific AI provider dependencies
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture reserved for future direct integration
- **Focus**: DDX remains a structured workflow tool, not an AI platform

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Direct LLM API Integration
**Description**: Build native API clients for Claude, GPT, and other LLM providers

**Pros**:
- Direct control over AI interactions
- Custom prompting strategies
- Integrated user experience
- Potential for advanced features

**Cons**:
- Complex API key management
- Vendor-specific code maintenance
- Rate limiting and quota concerns
- Authentication and security complexity
- Diverts focus from core DDX mission
- Network dependency for core functionality

**Evaluation**: Rejected - adds complexity without clear value over CLI agents

### Option 2: Plugin-Based AI Integration
**Description**: Create plugin system for various AI providers

**Pros**:
- Extensible architecture
- User choice of providers
- Isolated vendor dependencies
- Community contributions possible

**Cons**:
- Significant architecture complexity
- Plugin security concerns
- Maintenance overhead
- Implementation time diverts from core features
- CLI agents already provide this flexibility

**Evaluation**: Rejected for current phase - may revisit in future

### Option 3: CLI Agent Integration (Selected)
**Description**: Design templates and prompts for consumption by AI CLI agents

**Pros**:
- Leverages existing AI agent capabilities
- No vendor lock-in
- Simple integration model
- Agents handle authentication/API management
- DDX stays focused on core mission
- Works with multiple agents

**Cons**:
- Requires CLI agent as intermediary - acceptable given agent quality
- Less direct control over AI behavior - mitigated by prompt design
- Dependent on agent capabilities - agents are rapidly improving

**Evaluation**: Selected for optimal balance of capability, simplicity, and focus

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Works with any AI agent that can read templates
- **Simplicity**: No API management, authentication, or rate limiting
- **Focus**: DDX remains focused on structured workflows
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose their preferred AI agent
- **Offline Support**: Core DDX functionality works without network
- **Rapid Development**: Leverage existing agent capabilities

### Negative Consequences
- **Indirect Control**: Cannot directly optimize AI interactions
- **Agent Dependency**: Requires users to have AI agent installed
- **Feature Limitations**: Constrained by agent capabilities
- **Integration Overhead**: Templates must be designed for agent consumption

### Neutral Consequences
- **Template Design**: Must consider AI agent parsing capabilities
- **Prompt Engineering**: Focus on effective prompt design for agents
- **Future Optionality**: Can add direct integration later if needed

## Implementation Impact

### Development Impact
- **Effort**: Low - Focus on template/prompt optimization
- **Time**: Minimal additional development required
- **Skills Required**: Prompt engineering, AI agent familiarity

### Operational Impact
- **Performance**: Excellent - No network calls from DDX
- **Scalability**: Not applicable - agents handle scaling
- **Maintenance**: Low - No AI provider API maintenance

### Security Impact
- No API keys to manage
- No network attack surface
- Standard file security model
- Agent handles AI provider security

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Agent unavailability | Low | Medium | Core DDX works without agents |
| Agent quality variance | Medium | Low | Design templates for multiple agents |
| Future direct integration need | Medium | Low | Architecture supports plugin addition |
| Template/agent compatibility | Low | Low | Test with multiple agents |

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Markdown and YAML parsing by AI agents
- Agent ability to follow structured prompts
- File system access for agents

### Decision Dependencies
- ADR-001: Template/prompt structure enables agent consumption
- ADR-007: Variable substitution supports agent workflow
- ADR-004: Starlark validators work with agent-generated content

## Validation

### How We'll Know This Was Right
- AI agents effectively consume DDX templates and prompts
- Users report improved productivity with DDX + AI agents
- No user requests for direct LLM integration
- Template/prompt quality improves agent output
- DDX remains focused and maintainable

### Review Triggers
This decision should be reviewed if:
- Multiple users request direct LLM integration
- CLI agents become inadequate for DDX workflows
- Direct integration provides compelling advantages
- Vendor-specific features become critical
- Agent market consolidates significantly
