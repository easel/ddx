# ADR-003: Implement DDX CLI Using Go

**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: DDX Development Team
**Related Feature(s)**: Cross-cutting - CLI Implementation
**Confidence Level**: High

## Context

DDX requires a command-line interface that runs on multiple platforms, executes Git commands reliably, provides fast execution with minimal startup time, and distributes as a single binary with no runtime dependencies.

### Problem Statement

What programming language and framework should we use to implement the DDX CLI to ensure cross-platform compatibility, fast performance, easy distribution, and maintainable codebase while minimizing dependencies?

### Current State

CLI tools are commonly built with various languages: Node.js/TypeScript for web developers, Python for data scientists, Rust for systems programmers, and Go for cloud-native tools. Each has trade-offs in terms of performance, distribution, and developer experience.

### Requirements Driving This Decision
- Run identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Execute Git commands reliably
- Single binary distribution with no runtime dependencies
- Startup time < 100ms for simple commands
- Parse and process YAML configurations efficiently
- Handle concurrent operations safely
- Integrate well with existing Go ecosystem

## Decision

We will implement the DDX CLI using Go (Golang) with the Cobra framework for command structure and Viper for configuration management.

### Key Points
- Go compiles to self-contained native binaries
- Cobra provides industry-standard CLI framework
- Viper handles configuration with multiple formats
- Excellent cross-compilation support
- Fast startup and execution speed
- Strong standard library for OS operations
- Growing ecosystem of CLI tools in Go

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Rust
**Description**: Implement CLI using Rust for maximum performance and safety

**Pros**:
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety guarantees
- Excellent performance
- Small binary sizes possible
- Growing ecosystem

**Cons**:
- Steep learning curve for team
- Slower development velocity
- Smaller talent pool
- Complex async model
- Longer compile times

**Evaluation**: Rejected - performance benefits don't outweigh development complexity

### Option 2: Node.js/TypeScript
**Description**: Build CLI using Node.js with TypeScript

**Pros**:
- Large ecosystem
- Familiar to many developers
- Fast development
- Excellent JSON/YAML handling
- Good testing frameworks

**Cons**:
- Requires Node.js runtime
- Slow startup time (200-500ms)
- Complex distribution
- Large package sizes
- Runtime errors possible

**Evaluation**: Rejected - runtime dependency violates requirements

### Option 3: Go (Selected)
**Description**: Implement using Go with Cobra framework

**Pros**:
- Single binary distribution
- Fast startup (<100ms)
- Cross-platform compilation
- Strong standard library
- Cobra/Viper ecosystem
- Growing CLI community

**Cons**:
- Larger binaries than C/Rust - acceptable at 10-20MB
- Garbage collection - negligible for CLI use
- Verbose error handling - improves reliability

**Evaluation**: Selected for optimal balance of performance, development speed, and distribution

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Fast Execution**: Sub-100ms startup achieved
- **Easy Distribution**: Single binary via curl/wget
- **Cross-platform**: Identical behavior across OS
- **Reliable Operations**: Strong standard library
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Leverage Cobra, Viper, etc.
- **Maintainable**: Clear, typed code

### Negative Consequences
- **Binary Size**: 10-20MB per platform
- **GC Pauses**: Possible but negligible for CLI
- **Error Verbosity**: Explicit handling required
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs Go proficiency

### Neutral Consequences
- **Opinionated Language**: Reduces style debates
- **Limited Metaprogramming**: More predictable code
- **Built-in Testing**: Standard framework included

## Implementation Impact

### Development Impact
- **Effort**: Medium - Team learning Go idioms
- **Time**: 2-3 weeks for initial CLI
- **Skills Required**: Go proficiency, Cobra knowledge

### Operational Impact
- **Performance**: Excellent - native execution
- **Scalability**: Not applicable for CLI
- **Maintenance**: Low - stable language and libraries

### Security Impact
- Memory safe by default
- No buffer overflows
- Built-in concurrency safety
- Standard crypto libraries

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Team Go proficiency | Medium | Medium | Training and pair programming |
| Binary size growth | Low | Low | Build optimization flags |
| Dependency management | Low | Low | Go modules vendoring |
| Cross-platform issues | Low | Medium | CI testing on all platforms |

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Go 1.21+ (latest stable)
- Cobra CLI framework
- Viper configuration library
- Standard Go toolchain

### Decision Dependencies
- ADR-001: CLI must handle workflow structure
- ADR-002: CLI wraps git subtree commands
- ADR-004: May need to embed Starlark

## Validation

### How We'll Know This Was Right
- Startup time consistently < 100ms
- Binary size < 20MB compressed
- Zero runtime dependencies
- Cross-platform tests pass
- Developer productivity maintained

### Review Triggers
This decision should be reviewed if:
- Go 2.0 introduces breaking changes
- Binary size exceeds 30MB
- Startup time exceeds 200ms
- Better CLI frameworks emerge
- Team velocity concerns arise
