# ADR-008: Community Contribution and Review Process

**Date**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Proposed
**Deciders**: DDX Development Team
**Technical Story**: Design the architecture for community contributions, quality assurance, and the review process for shared assets

## Context

### Problem Statement
DDX needs a robust contribution system that:
- Enables easy sharing of templates, patterns, and improvements
- Maintains quality standards across contributions
- Provides clear attribution and licensing
- Supports automated validation and testing
- Facilitates collaborative review and iteration
- Scales from individual contributors to organizations
- Prevents malicious or low-quality content

### Forces at Play
- **Ease of Contribution**: Low friction for sharing improvements
- **Quality Control**: Maintain high standards for shared assets
- **Attribution**: Proper credit for contributors
- **Security**: Prevent malicious contributions
- **Scalability**: Handle growth from 10 to 10,000 contributors
- **Discovery**: Make contributions easily findable
- **Versioning**: Track changes and enable rollbacks

### Constraints
- Must work with git-based workflows
- Cannot require specialized infrastructure
- Should support offline contribution preparation
- Must handle intellectual property concerns
- Need to support private/organizational contributions
- Must integrate with existing CI/CD systems

## Decision

### Chosen Approach
Implement a multi-tier contribution architecture:
1. **Git-based contribution flow** using pull requests
2. **Automated quality gates** with CI/CD validation
3. **Tiered review process** based on contribution scope
4. **Reputation system** for trusted contributors
5. **Modular asset structure** for composability

### Contribution Tiers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Tier 3: Core                │
│    (Core team, major features)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Tier 2: Trusted             │
│    (Verified contributors)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Tier 1: Community           │
│    (All contributors)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Tier 1: Community Contributions
- Open to all contributors

- Automated validation required
- Two approvals needed
- 7-day review period

#### Tier 2: Trusted Contributors
- Earned after 5 approved contributions
- Simplified review process
- One approval needed
- 3-day review period
- Can review Tier 1 contributions

#### Tier 3: Core Contributors
- Core team members
- Direct commit access for urgent fixes
- Self-review for minor changes
- Set quality standards

```

### Quality Gates

#### Automated Validation
```yaml
validation:
  syntax:
    - YAML lint
    - Markdown lint
    - Template syntax check
    - Starlark validation

  structure:
    - Required files present
    - Directory structure compliance
    - Naming conventions
    - File size limits

  content:
    - No secrets or credentials
    - No PII or sensitive data
    - License compatibility
    - Documentation completeness

  security:
    - Virus/malware scan
    - Dependency vulnerability check
    - Code injection detection
    - Path traversal prevention

  quality:
    - Test coverage (if applicable)
    - Example validation
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Complexity metrics
```

#### Human Review Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] Clear purpose and use case
- [ ] Follows DDX patterns and conventions
- [ ] Well-documented with examples
- [ ] No duplication of existing assets
- [ ] Appropriate categorization/tags
- [ ] Works across target platforms
- [ ] Includes tests where applicable
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] License compatible
```

### Asset Metadata Standard
```yaml
# asset-metadata.yml
metadata:
  name: "Asset Name"
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "Brief description"
  authors:
    - name: "John Doe"
      email: "john@example.com"
      github: "@johndoe"
  license: "MIT"
  tags:
    - category: "web"
    - language: "typescript"
    - framework: "react"
  compatibility:
    ddx_version: ">=1.0.0"
    platforms: ["linux", "darwin", "windows"]
  dependencies:
    - name: "other-asset"
      version: ">=2.0.0"
  quality:
    tested: true
    examples: true
    benchmarked: false
  support:
    documentation: "https://..."
    issues: "https://..."
    discussions: "https://..."
```

### Reputation System
```go
type ContributorReputation struct {
    GitHubUser      string
    Contributions   int
    Accepted        int
    Rejected        int
    QualityScore    float64  // 0-100
    TrustLevel      int      // 1-3
    Specializations []string // Areas of expertise
    LastActive      time.Time
}

// Quality Score Calculation
QualityScore = (
    0.4 * AcceptanceRate +
    0.3 * ReviewScore +
    0.2 * CommunityVotes +
    0.1 * ResponseTime
)
```

### Rationale
- **Git-based**: Leverages existing developer workflows
- **Automated Gates**: Catches issues early, reduces review burden
- **Tiered System**: Balances quality with contribution velocity
- **Reputation**: Incentivizes quality contributions
- **Modular**: Enables composition and reuse

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Centralized Registry Service
**Description**: Build a web-based registry like npm or Docker Hub

**Pros**:
- Rich web interface
- Advanced search and discovery
- Download statistics
- User ratings and reviews

## Notes

The contribution system aligns with DDX's medical metaphor - like peer-reviewed medical research, contributions undergo rigorous review before being accepted into the body of knowledge. The reputation system mirrors medical credentials, where expertise is earned through demonstrated competence.

Key insight: By automating the mechanical aspects of review while preserving human judgment for quality assessment, we can scale the contribution process without sacrificing standards.

Implementation tip: Start with strict quality gates and relax them based on data rather than starting loose and tightening later. It's easier to reduce friction than to raise standards after the fact.

The tiered system mirrors medical publication - from general submissions (Tier 1) to peer review (Tier 2) to editorial board (Tier 3), ensuring appropriate scrutiny at each level.
