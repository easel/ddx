| Security | Encrypted downloads, integrity verification | HTTPS, checksums, signatures | TLS + SHA256 verification |
| Usability | Single command installation | Minimal user interaction | Automated detection and setup |
| Compatibility | macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+, Windows 10+ | Platform-specific installers | OS-specific installation paths |

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Shell Script Installation (curl/wget)
**Description**: Single shell script that detects platform and downloads appropriate binary

**Pros**:
- Simple, widely-used pattern (used by Rust, Node.js, etc.)
- Single command installation experience
- No dependencies beyond curl/wget
- Easy to maintain and understand

**Cons**:
- Platform detection complexity in shell script
- Limited error handling capabilities
- Security concerns with pipe-to-shell
- Windows PowerShell version needed separately

**Evaluation**: Good for Unix-like systems but needs Windows solution

### Approach 2: Native Installers Per Platform
**Description**: Platform-specific installers (.pkg, .msi, .deb, .rpm)

**Pros**:
- Native user experience per platform
- Integrated with OS package management
- Professional appearance and trust
- Automatic uninstall support

**Cons**:
- Complex build and signing process
- Different installer for each platform/distro
- Requires code signing certificates
- Slow release cycle due to complexity

**Evaluation**: Professional but too complex for v1

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach with GitHub Releases (Selected)
**Description**: GitHub Releases for binary hosting with smart install script

**Pros**:
- Leverages GitHub's CDN and reliability
- Automatic checksums and release management
- Single install script with platform detection
- Easy to add package managers later
- Community-familiar pattern

**Cons**:
- Dependency on GitHub availability
- Limited to GitHub's artifact limits
- Need fallback for corporate networks

**Evaluation**: Optimal balance of simplicity and functionality

**Rationale**: Aligns with open-source distribution patterns while providing reliable, fast installation. GitHub Releases provide built-in CDN, checksums, and release management. Can evolve to native installers in future versions.

## Domain Model

### Core Entities
Identify the key business concepts:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Platform {
        string os
        string arch
        string variant
        string[] supported_managers
    }
    Binary {
        string version
        string platform
        string url
        string checksum
        int size
    }
    Installation {
        string id
        string platform
        string version
        string install_path
        datetime installed_at
        string status
    }
    PackageManager {
        string name
        string command
        string[] supported_os
        bool available
    }
    InstallMethod {
        string type
        int priority
        string[] requirements
        func install
    }
    Platform ||--o{ Binary : "has binaries"
    Installation ||--|| Platform : "targets"
    Installation ||--|| Binary : "installs"
    PackageManager ||--o{ Platform : "supports"
    InstallMethod ||--o{ PackageManager : "uses"
```

### Business Rules
Critical domain logic to implement:
1. **Platform Compatibility**: Only install binaries compatible with detected platform
2. **Version Consistency**: All installed components must be same DDX version
3. **Atomic Installation**: Installation succeeds completely or fails completely
4. **No Admin Privileges**: Must install to user-accessible directories only
5. **PATH Safety**: Never corrupt existing PATH, always provide rollback
6. **Checksum Verification**: All downloads must pass integrity checks
7. **Single Instance**: Only one version of DDX per installation location

### Bounded Contexts
- **Platform Detection Context**: OS, architecture, and capability detection
- **Binary Distribution Context**: Download, verification, and storage
- **Installation Context**: File placement, PATH configuration, verification
- **Package Management Context**: Integration with OS package managers

## Technology Selection Rationale

### Installation Script: Shell Script + PowerShell
**Why**: Ubiquitous availability, no dependencies, familiar to users
**Alternatives Considered**: Native binaries (chicken-and-egg problem), Python (not always available)

### Binary Distribution: GitHub Releases
**Why**: Free hosting, built-in CDN, checksums, familiar to developers
**Alternatives Considered**: Custom CDN (expensive), package registries (platform-specific)

### Platform Detection: Runtime Detection
**Why**: Most accurate, adapts to actual environment
**Alternatives Considered**: User specification (error-prone), build matrix (incomplete coverage)

### Checksum Verification: SHA256
**Why**: Industry standard, good security/performance balance
**Alternatives Considered**: MD5 (insecure), SHA512 (overkill for this use case)

### Installation Directory: User Home
**Why**: No admin privileges required, user owns the installation
**Alternatives Considered**: System directories (need admin), /usr/local (not Windows compatible)

## Requirements Traceability

### Coverage Check
Ensure all requirements are addressed:

| Requirement ID | Requirement | Component | Design Element | Test Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| US-028 | One-command installation | InstallationManager | Shell script wrapper | Integration test full install flow |
| US-029 | Automatic PATH configuration | EnvironmentConfigurer | Shell profile modification | Test PATH changes in clean environments |
| US-030 | Installation verification | InstallationValidator | Post-install testing | Verify ddx command works |

### Gap Analysis
Requirements not fully addressed:
- [ ] Corporate proxy support: Will be added through environment variable detection
- [ ] Air-gapped installation: Will provide downloadable installer bundles

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- GitHub rate limits: 5000 requests/hour for unauthenticated users
- Binary size limits: GitHub releases limited to 2GB per file
- Platform variations: Each OS/arch needs separate binary
- Shell compatibility: Must work with bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell

### Assumptions
- Users have curl/wget or PowerShell: Standard on target platforms
- Internet access for initial install: Offline mode available as alternative
- Write permissions to home directory: Standard user capability
- PATH modification acceptable: Users expect this for CLI tools

### Dependencies
- GitHub API availability: Primary distribution method
- HTTP client (curl/wget): For downloads
- Shell environment: For PATH modification
- File system permissions: For installation

## Migration from Current State

### Current System Analysis
- **Existing functionality**: Manual installation instructions
- **Data migration needs**: None - new installation system
- **Integration points**: Must work with existing DDX binary

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Create automated installation script
2. **Phase 2**: Add package manager support
3. **Phase 3**: Create offline installation packages
4. **Compatibility period**: Maintain manual instructions as fallback

## Implementation Notes

### Key Implementation Patterns

#### Platform Detection
```bash
# Shell script platform detection
detect_platform() {
    local os arch
    case "$(uname -s)" in
        Darwin) os="darwin" ;;
        Linux) os="linux" ;;
        MINGW*) os="windows" ;;
        *) echo "Unsupported OS: $(uname -s)" && exit 1 ;;
    esac

    case "$(uname -m)" in
        x86_64|amd64) arch="amd64" ;;
        aarch64|arm64) arch="arm64" ;;
        *) echo "Unsupported architecture: $(uname -m)" && exit 1 ;;
    esac

    echo "${os}_${arch}"
}
```

#### Installation Process
```bash
# Main installation flow
install_ddx() {
    local platform version install_dir

    platform=$(detect_platform)
    version=$(get_latest_version)
    install_dir=$(get_install_directory)

    echo "Installing DDX ${version} for ${platform}..."

    # Download and verify
    download_binary "${platform}" "${version}" "${install_dir}"
    verify_checksum "${install_dir}/ddx" "${version}" "${platform}"

    # Configure environment
    setup_path "${install_dir}"

    # Verify installation
    verify_installation "${install_dir}/ddx"

    echo "DDX installed successfully!"
    echo "Run 'ddx --help' to get started."
}
```

#### PATH Configuration
```bash
# Configure shell PATH
setup_path() {
    local install_dir="$1"
    local shell_rc profile_updated

    # Detect current shell
    shell_rc=$(detect_shell_rc)

    # Check if already in PATH
    if echo "$PATH" | grep -q "${install_dir}"; then
        echo "DDX already in PATH"
        return
    fi

    # Add to PATH
    echo "export PATH=\"${install_dir}:\$PATH\"" >> "${shell_rc}"
    export PATH="${install_dir}:$PATH"

    profile_updated=true
}
```

### Installation Commands
```bash
# Primary installation methods
curl -sSL https://ddx.dev/install | sh                    # Unix/Linux/macOS
iwr -useb https://ddx.dev/install.ps1 | iex              # Windows PowerShell

# Package manager installations (future)
brew install ddx                                          # macOS Homebrew
sudo apt install ddx                                      # Ubuntu/Debian
winget install ddx                                        # Windows Package Manager

# Verification command
ddx --version                                             # Verify installation
```
