# Contributing Workflows to DDX

This guide outlines how to share your workflows with the DDX community, ensuring high-quality contributions that benefit everyone.

## Why Contribute?

When you contribute a workflow to DDX, you:
- **Help others** solve similar problems more efficiently
- **Improve your own workflow** through community feedback
- **Build reputation** as a thought leader in your domain
- **Strengthen the ecosystem** by adding proven patterns

Following DDX's medical metaphor, contributing workflows is like sharing treatment protocols - proven procedures that help others achieve better outcomes.

## Contribution Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

Before contributing, ensure your workflow meets quality standards:

#### 1. Real-World Testing
- [ ] Used the workflow on at least 2 different projects
- [ ] Collected feedback from team members or colleagues
- [ ] Refined based on practical experience
- [ ] Documented lessons learned and common pitfalls

#### 2. Structure Validation
- [ ] Follows standard DDX workflow structure
- [ ] All required files present (README, GUIDE, workflow.yml)
- [ ] Templates are clean and well-structured
- [ ] Prompts provide clear guidance
- [ ] Examples are real and representative

#### 3. Quality Review
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked
- [ ] Cross-links verified
- [ ] Consistent tagging throughout
- [ ] No sensitive information included

### Phase 2: Community Review

#### 1. Internal Review
Before public submission:
- Share with your team or trusted colleagues
- Run through the entire workflow with someone unfamiliar with it
- Address feedback and iterate
- Document any changes made

#### 2. Public Submission
Use DDX's contribution system:

```bash
# Create a branch for your contribution
git checkout -b contribute/workflow-{your-workflow-name}

# Add your workflow
cp -r your-workflow/ workflows/{workflow-name}/

# Validate structure
ddx workflow validate {workflow-name}

# Submit contribution
ddx contribute
```

#### 3. Community Feedback
Once submitted:
- Respond promptly to reviewer feedback
- Be open to suggestions and improvements
- Clarify documentation where needed
- Make requested changes quickly

### Phase 3: Integration

#### 1. Final Review
Core maintainers will:
- Test the workflow end-to-end
- Verify all documentation is complete
- Check for conflicts with existing workflows
- Ensure it follows DDX conventions

#### 2. Publication
Once approved:
- Workflow is merged into main repository
- Added to workflow registry
- Announced to community
- You're credited as the contributor

## Medical Metaphor

In keeping with DDX's medical theme:
- **Contributors** = Medical Researchers
- **Workflows** = Treatment Protocols
- **Review Process** = Peer Review
- **Community** = Medical Community
- **Quality Standards** = Clinical Standards

Just as medical researchers share their findings to improve patient care, workflow contributors share their discoveries to improve development outcomes for everyone.
