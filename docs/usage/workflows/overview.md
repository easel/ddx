# DDX Workflows Overview

## What is a Workflow?

A workflow in DDX is a structured, repeatable process that guides you through complex tasks. Following DDX's medical metaphor, workflows are "treatment protocols" - proven procedures for addressing specific development challenges.

Workflows combine:
- **Patterns**: Conceptual frameworks explaining the methodology
- **Templates**: Structural skeletons for documents and artifacts
- **Prompts**: AI-powered intelligence that helps fill templates
- **Automation**: Scripts and metadata that streamline the process

## Why Use Workflows?

### Consistency
Workflows ensure that complex processes are executed consistently across projects and teams. Whether you're defining product requirements or implementing features, workflows provide a reliable framework.

### Knowledge Sharing
Workflows capture best practices and make them shareable. When you discover an effective approach, you can encode it in a workflow and share it with the community.

### AI Enhancement
By combining templates with intelligent prompts, workflows maximize the value of AI assistants. The AI knows exactly what structure to follow and what information to gather.

### Progressive Learning
Workflows support users at every level:
- **Beginners** can follow step-by-step guides
- **Intermediate users** can customize templates
- **Experts** can create new workflows

## Core Concepts

### Templates as Structure
Templates are pure structural documents - skeletons with placeholders. They define WHAT needs to be created without specifying HOW to create it.

Example:
```markdown
# Product Requirements Document: [Product Name]

## Problem Statement
[Description of the problem]

## Solution
[Proposed solution]
```

### Prompts as Intelligence
Prompts embed or reference templates and add the intelligence layer. They know HOW to fill the template with appropriate content.

Example:
```markdown
# PRD Creation Assistant

Template: [[prd/template|PRD Template]]

## Questions to Answer:
- What problem are you solving?
- Who are your users?
- What's your unique value proposition?
```

### Patterns as Methodology
Patterns document the overall approach - the WHY and WHEN of using a particular workflow.

### Metadata as Automation
YAML files enable tooling and automation, defining phases, dependencies, and transitions.

## Workflow Structure

Every workflow follows this structure:
```
workflows/{name}/
├── README.md           # Pattern documentation
├── workflow.yml        # Metadata and automation
├── GUIDE.md           # Comprehensive guide
├── {artifact}/        # Each major artifact
│   ├── README.md     # About this artifact
│   ├── template.md   # The skeleton
│   ├── prompt.md     # AI assistance
│   └── examples/     # Real examples
└── phases/           # Phase documentation
```

## Available Workflows

### Development Workflow
[[workflows/development/README|Development Workflow]] - The complete software development lifecycle from product definition through release.

Phases:
1. **Define** - Product requirements and vision
2. **Design** - Technical architecture and system design
3. **Implement** - Feature development and coding
4. **Test** - Quality assurance and validation
5. **Release** - Deployment and distribution
6. **Iterate** - Feedback and improvement

### Future Workflows
- **Debugging Workflow** - Systematic problem-solving
- **Optimization Workflow** - Performance improvement
- **Incident Response** - Production issue handling
- **Onboarding Workflow** - New team member integration

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Available Workflows**: Explore the `workflows/` directory
2. **Choose a Workflow**: Select one that matches your needs
3. **Apply the Workflow**: Use `ddx apply workflows/{name}`
4. **Follow the Phases**: Work through each phase systematically
5. **Contribute Improvements**: Share your enhancements back

## Workflow Commands

DDX provides commands to work with workflows:

```bash
# List available workflows
ddx workflow list

# Apply a workflow
ddx workflow apply development

# Create a new workflow
ddx workflow create

# Validate workflow structure
ddx workflow validate
```

See [[docs/product/features/workflows/commands|Workflow Commands]] for detailed specifications.

## Creating Your Own Workflows

Want to create a custom workflow? See [[creating-workflows|Creating Workflows Guide]] for a comprehensive tutorial.

Quick start:
```bash
ddx apply prompts/ddx/create-workflow
```

## Integration with Obsidian

Workflows are designed to work seamlessly with Obsidian for knowledge management. See [[obsidian-integration|Obsidian Integration Guide]] for setup instructions.

## Best Practices

### Start Simple
Begin with existing workflows before creating your own. Understanding how the development workflow works will help you design better custom workflows.

### Document Everything
Good documentation is crucial. Each workflow should clearly explain:
- When to use it
- What it produces
- How to customize it

### Share Back
When you improve a workflow or create a new one, contribute it back to the community. See [[contributing-workflows|Contributing Workflows]].

### Iterate and Improve
Workflows aren't static. As you use them, you'll find improvements. Update the workflow and share your learnings.

## Medical Metaphor

In keeping with DDX's medical theme:
- **Workflows** = Treatment Protocols
- **Phases** = Treatment Steps
- **Templates** = Medical Forms
- **Prompts** = Clinical Guidelines
- **Examples** = Case Studies
- **Validation** = Quality Assurance

Just as medical protocols ensure consistent, high-quality patient care, DDX workflows ensure consistent, high-quality software development.
