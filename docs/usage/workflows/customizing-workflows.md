# Customizing DDX Workflows

This guide explains how to adapt DDX workflows to your specific needs, team requirements, and project contexts while maintaining the core structure and benefits.

## Philosophy of Customization

DDX workflows are designed with customization in mind. Like medical treatment protocols that are adapted for individual patients, workflows should be tailored to your specific context while preserving their proven effectiveness.

### Levels of Customization

1. **Configuration Level**: Adjust variables and settings
2. **Template Level**: Modify structures and sections
3. **Process Level**: Add, remove, or reorder phases
4. **Integration Level**: Connect with your existing tools
5. **Organizational Level**: Adapt for team and company standards

## Customization Points

### Variables and Configuration

Most workflows support variable substitution to adapt to different contexts:

#### Project Variables
```yaml
# .ddx/config.yml
variables:
  project_name: "My Awesome Project"
  team_name: "Platform Team"
  primary_language: "Go"
  deployment_target: "Kubernetes"
  documentation_tool: "Obsidian"
```

#### Team Variables
```yaml
# Team-specific overrides
team:
  review_process: "github-pr"
  testing_framework: "pytest"
  deployment_pipeline: "github-actions"
  communication_tool: "slack"
```

#### Organization Variables
```yaml
# Company-wide standards
organization:
  security_requirements: "enterprise"
  compliance_framework: "SOC2"
  code_style: "company-standard"
  license: "proprietary"
```

### Template Customization

#### Adding Sections
You can extend templates with additional sections relevant to your context:

```markdown
<!-- Original template -->
# Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement
[Description of the problem]

## Solution Overview
[High-level solution approach]

<!-- Your custom additions -->
## Security Considerations
[Security requirements and implications]

## Compliance Requirements
[Regulatory and legal considerations]

## Budget Impact
[Cost analysis and budget implications]
```

#### Modifying Structure
Reorganize templates to match your preferred structure:

```markdown
<!-- Reorganized for executive focus -->
# Executive Summary
[High-level overview for stakeholders]

# Business Case
## Problem Statement
## Market Opportunity
## Expected ROI

# Technical Solution
## Architecture Overview
## Implementation Plan
```

#### Custom Placeholders
Add placeholders for information specific to your domain:

```markdown
# [Product Name] - [Version] Requirements

## Stakeholders
- Product Owner: [product_owner]
- Tech Lead: [tech_lead]
- QA Lead: [qa_lead]
- [Custom Role]: [custom_contact]

## [Custom Section Name]
[custom_content_area]
```

### Phase Customization

#### Adding Phases
Insert additional phases for your specific workflow:

```yaml
# Original phases
phases:
  - define
  - design
  - implement
  - test
  - release

# Your customized phases
phases:
  - define
  - security-review    # Added security review
  - design
  - architecture-review  # Added architecture review
  - implement
  - code-review        # Added dedicated code review
  - test
  - performance-test   # Added performance testing
  - security-test      # Added security testing
  - release
  - post-launch       # Added post-launch monitoring
```

#### Modifying Phase Content
Adapt phases to match your team's practices:

```yaml
# Modified test phase
test:
  name: "Quality Assurance"
  activities:
    - unit_tests: "Run comprehensive unit test suite"
    - integration_tests: "Execute integration test scenarios"
    - accessibility_tests: "Verify WCAG 2.1 compliance"  # Added
    - security_tests: "Run security vulnerability scans"  # Added
    - performance_tests: "Load test critical paths"       # Added
  tools:
    - pytest
    - selenium
    - axe-core    # Added
    - burp-suite  # Added
    - k6          # Added
```

#### Removing Phases
Skip phases that don't apply to your context:

```yaml
# Minimal workflow for prototypes
phases:
  - define
  - implement    # Skip design for rapid prototyping
  - test         # Simplified testing
  # Skip formal release process
```

## Variable Substitution

### Built-in Variables

DDX provides several built-in variables:

```yaml
# Date/time variables
{{date}}              # Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
{{timestamp}}         # Current timestamp
{{year}}              # Current year

# Project variables
{{project_name}}      # From project config
{{project_version}}   # From package.json, etc.
{{project_description}}

# User variables
{{author}}            # Git user name
{{author_email}}      # Git user email

# Team variables
{{team_name}}         # From team config
{{team_lead}}         # Team lead contact

# Environment variables
{{environment}}       # dev/staging/prod
{{deployment_target}} # Deployment platform
```

### Custom Variables

Define your own variables for consistent reuse:

#### Global Variables
```yaml
# ~/.ddx/global.yml
variables:
  company_name: "Acme Corporation"
  company_url: "https://acme.com"
  support_email: "support@acme.com"
  
  # Standards
  code_style_guide: "https://acme.com/coding-standards"
  security_policy: "https://acme.com/security-policy"
  
  # Templates
  ticket_template: "[ACME-{{ticket_id}}] {{title}}"
  branch_template: "feature/ACME-{{ticket_id}}-{{feature_name}}"
```

#### Project Variables
```yaml
# .ddx/project.yml
variables:
  # Project-specific
  api_base_url: "https://api.myproject.com"
  database_type: "PostgreSQL"
  primary_framework: "React"
  
  # Team assignments
  backend_lead: "alice@company.com"
  frontend_lead: "bob@company.com"
  qa_lead: "carol@company.com"
```

#### Dynamic Variables
Generate variables programmatically:

```yaml
# Variables with dynamic values
variables:
  sprint_number:
    type: "computed"
    expression: "date.week_of_year()"
  
  next_release:
    type: "computed"  
    expression: "project.version.increment('minor')"
    
  team_capacity:
    type: "query"
    query: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_members WHERE available = true"
```

### Variable Scoping

Variables follow a hierarchical precedence:

1. **Command-line arguments** (highest priority)
2. **Project-specific variables** (.ddx/project.yml)
3. **Team variables** (.ddx/team.yml)
4. **Global variables** (~/.ddx/global.yml)
5. **Workflow defaults** (lowest priority)

```bash
# Override variables at command line
ddx workflow apply development \
  --var project_name="Custom Project" \
  --var environment="staging"
```

## Extending Phases and Artifacts

### Adding Custom Artifacts

Create new artifact types for your specific needs:

```yaml
# workflow.yml - Add custom artifacts
artifacts:
  # Standard artifacts
  - id: prd
    name: "Product Requirements Document"
    
  # Custom artifacts
  - id: risk-assessment
    name: "Risk Assessment Matrix"
    template: "risk-assessment/template.md"
    prompt: "risk-assessment/prompt.md"
    required: true
    phase: "define"
    
  - id: compliance-checklist
    name: "Compliance Verification"
    template: "compliance/checklist.md"
    prompt: "compliance/prompt.md"
    required: true
    phase: "test"
```

### Custom Artifact Structure

```
workflows/development-custom/
├── risk-assessment/
│   ├── README.md          # What is a risk assessment?
│   ├── template.md        # Risk assessment template
│   ├── prompt.md          # AI guidance for risk analysis
│   └── examples/
│       ├── web-app.md     # Example for web applications
│       └── api-service.md # Example for API services
│
└── compliance/
    ├── README.md          # Compliance overview
    ├── checklist.md       # Compliance checklist template
    ├── prompt.md          # Compliance verification guidance
    └── examples/
        └── gdpr.md        # GDPR compliance example
```

### Phase Dependencies

Define custom dependencies between phases:

```yaml
# Complex dependency structure
phases:
  - id: define
    
  - id: security-review
    requires: [define]
    blocking: [design]  # Must complete before design
    
  - id: design
    requires: [define, security-review]
    
  - id: architecture-review
    requires: [design]
    parallel: [security-review]  # Can run in parallel
    
  - id: implement
    requires: [design, architecture-review]
```

## Team-Specific Modifications

### Role-Based Customization

Adapt workflows for different team roles:

#### Developer-Focused Version
```yaml
# Emphasizes technical artifacts
artifacts:
  - technical-spec       # Detailed technical design
  - api-documentation   # API specifications
  - test-strategy       # Testing approach
  - deployment-guide    # Deployment procedures

phases:
  - technical-design    # Deep technical planning
  - implementation     # Coding and development
  - peer-review        # Code review process
  - integration-test   # Technical testing
```

#### Product-Focused Version
```yaml
# Emphasizes business artifacts
artifacts:
  - market-analysis     # Market research
  - user-stories       # User requirements
  - success-metrics    # KPIs and measurement
  - go-to-market       # Launch strategy

phases:
  - market-research    # Market validation
  - user-research      # User needs analysis
  - product-design     # Product specification
  - launch-planning    # Go-to-market strategy
```

### Communication Preferences

Customize workflows for team communication styles:

```yaml
# Async-first team
communication:
  decision_making: "rfc"           # RFC process for decisions
  updates: "async-written"         # Written status updates
  reviews: "pull-request"          # Code review via PRs
  planning: "collaborative-docs"   # Shared document planning

# Meeting-heavy team  
communication:
  decision_making: "consensus-meeting"  # Decision meetings
  updates: "standup"                   # Daily standups
  reviews: "pair-programming"          # Live code review
  planning: "planning-poker"           # Estimation meetings
```

### Tool Integration

Adapt workflows to your tool ecosystem:

```yaml
# Tool-specific configurations
integrations:
  project_management:
    tool: "jira"
    ticket_template: "{{company_prefix}}-{{ticket_id}}"
    
  version_control:
    tool: "github"
    branch_strategy: "git-flow"
    pr_template: "templates/pr-template.md"
    
  ci_cd:
    tool: "github-actions"
    pipeline_config: ".github/workflows/ci.yml"
    
  documentation:
    tool: "obsidian"
    vault_location: "docs/"
    template_folder: "templates/workflows/"
```

## Advanced Customization

### Conditional Logic

Use conditions to adapt workflow behavior:

```yaml
# Environment-based conditions
artifacts:
  - id: security-review
    condition: "environment == 'production'"
    
  - id: performance-test
    condition: "project.type == 'api' or project.expected_load > 1000"
    
  - id: compliance-docs
    condition: "organization.compliance_required == true"

# Team-size based conditions
phases:
  - id: architecture-review
    condition: "team.size > 5"  # Only for larger teams
    
  - id: pair-programming
    condition: "team.experience_level == 'junior'"
```

### Multi-Environment Support

Customize for different deployment environments:

```yaml
# Environment-specific configurations
environments:
  development:
    phases: [define, implement, test]
    artifacts: [basic-spec, code, unit-tests]
    
  staging:
    phases: [define, design, implement, integration-test, deploy]
    artifacts: [detailed-spec, code, integration-tests, deployment-guide]
    
  production:
    phases: [define, design, security-review, implement, full-test, release]
    artifacts: [prd, architecture, security-assessment, code, test-suite, runbook]
```

### Workflow Inheritance

Create workflow hierarchies for reuse:

```yaml
# Base workflow
base_workflow: "workflows/standard-development"

# Customizations
extends: "base_workflow"
modifications:
  add_phases: [security-review, compliance-check]
  remove_phases: [manual-test]
  
  add_artifacts: [security-plan, compliance-report]
  modify_artifacts:
    prd:
      template: "templates/enterprise-prd.md"
      
variables:
  security_level: "high"
  compliance_framework: "SOC2"
```

### Custom Automation

Add your own automation to workflows:

```yaml
# Custom automation hooks
automation:
  on_phase_start:
    - create_branch: "feature/{{workflow.id}}-{{phase.name}}"
    - notify_team: "slack://{{team.channel}}"
    
  on_phase_complete:
    - update_tracking: "jira://{{ticket.id}}"
    - run_tests: "npm test"
    
  on_workflow_complete:
    - create_release: "github://{{repository}}"
    - send_report: "email://{{stakeholders}}"
```

## Organization-Level Customization

### Company Standards

Embed organizational standards into workflows:

```yaml
# Company-wide workflow configuration
organization:
  name: "Acme Corporation"
  standards:
    security: "enterprise"
    compliance: ["SOC2", "GDPR", "HIPAA"]
    documentation: "comprehensive"
    
  required_artifacts:
    - security-assessment
    - privacy-impact-assessment
    - accessibility-statement
    
  required_phases:
    - legal-review
    - security-review
    - accessibility-audit
```

### Governance Integration

Connect workflows to governance processes:

```yaml
# Governance checkpoints
governance:
  checkpoints:
    - phase: "design"
      gate: "architecture-board-approval"
      required_artifacts: [architecture-doc, cost-analysis]
      
    - phase: "release"
      gate: "change-advisory-board"
      required_artifacts: [deployment-plan, rollback-plan]
```

```yaml
# Service-specific considerations
additional_artifacts:
  - service-definition
  - api-contract
  - deployment-manifest
  - monitoring-config
  
variables:
  architecture_pattern: "microservices"
  container_platform: "kubernetes"
```

#### Monolithic Applications
```yaml
# Monolith-specific workflow
phases:
  - database-design    # Centralized data modeling
  - module-planning    # Internal module structure
  - integration-test   # Full system testing
  
variables:
  architecture_pattern: "monolith"
  deployment_strategy: "blue-green"
```

## Troubleshooting Customization

### Common Issues

#### Variable Substitution Errors
```bash
# Debug variable resolution
ddx workflow debug-vars development --verbose

# Check variable precedence
ddx workflow list-vars --scope=all
```

#### Template Conflicts
```bash
# Validate template structure
ddx workflow validate development --check-templates

# Compare with original
ddx workflow diff development --base=original
```

#### Phase Dependencies
```bash
# Visualize workflow graph
ddx workflow graph development

# Check for circular dependencies
ddx workflow validate --check-cycles
```

### Testing Customizations

#### Validation Commands
```bash
# Validate entire workflow
ddx workflow validate my-custom-workflow

# Test specific components
ddx workflow test-template prd/template.md
ddx workflow test-prompt prd/prompt.md

# Dry run through phases
ddx workflow simulate my-custom-workflow --dry-run
```

#### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test with different variable sets
ddx workflow test --vars=test-scenarios/web-app.yml
ddx workflow test --vars=test-scenarios/api-service.yml

# Test phase transitions
ddx workflow test-transitions my-custom-workflow
```

## Migration and Updates

### Updating Custom Workflows

When the base workflow is updated:

```bash
# Check for updates
ddx workflow check-updates development

# Preview changes
ddx workflow diff development --base=upstream

# Merge updates while preserving customizations
ddx workflow merge-updates development --preserve-custom
```

### Version Management

```yaml
# Track customization versions
customization:
  version: "2.1.0"
  base_version: "1.5.0"
  last_updated: "2024-01-15"
  
  changes:
    - "Added security review phase"
    - "Customized PRD template for enterprise"
    - "Added GDPR compliance artifacts"
```

## Medical Metaphor

In keeping with DDX's medical theme:
- **Customization** = Personalized Medicine
- **Variables** = Patient Parameters
- **Templates** = Treatment Forms
- **Phases** = Treatment Steps
- **Integration** = Medical Device Integration

Just as medical treatments are customized for individual patients while following proven protocols, DDX workflows are customized for specific contexts while maintaining their proven effectiveness.

## Next Steps

1. **Identify Needs**: What aspects of existing workflows don't fit your context?
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with variable substitution and small template changes
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate customizations work as expected
4. **Document Changes**: Record what you changed and why
5. **Share Learnings**: Contribute successful patterns back to the community

Remember: Customization should enhance, not replace, the proven structure of DDX workflows. The goal is to adapt the workflow to your context while preserving its effectiveness.
