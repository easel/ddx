# Microsoft Build 2025: The Age of AI Agents and Building the Open Agentic Web

## Executive Summary

Microsoft envisions a transformative future where AI agents operate across individual, organizational, team, and business contexts, making decisions and performing tasks on behalf of users or organizations. This represents a fundamental shift toward what they call the "Open Agentic Web."

## Key Vision: The Open Agentic Web

Microsoft's vision centers on creating an internet where:
- AI agents can make decisions and perform tasks autonomously
- Agents operate across multiple contexts (individual, organizational, team, business)
- Open standards enable interoperability between different agent systems
- The web evolves to support conversational, agent-driven interactions

## Core Technological Developments

### 1. Agent Platforms and Infrastructure

**GitHub Copilot Evolution**
- Transitioning from in-editor assistant to asynchronous coding agent
- First-of-its-kind asynchronous capabilities
- 15 million developers currently using the platform

**Windows AI Foundry**
- Unified platform supporting the AI developer lifecycle
- Covers both training and inference
- Simple model APIs for vision and language tasks
- Built-in reliability and performance optimization

**Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**
- Orchestration of multiple specialized agents
- 1,900+ models available for selection
- Enterprise-grade security and governance
- Comprehensive observability for agent performance

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Copilot Studio Capabilities**
- 230,000 organizations actively using the platform
- Ability to connect multiple agents to combine skills
- Tackling broader, more complex tasks through agent collaboration
- Custom agent building blocks for specialized needs

**Enterprise Agent Development**
- Secure data integration capabilities
- Enhanced governance features
- Observability and monitoring tools
- Custom agent creation workflows

### 3. Open Standards and Protocols

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- Key standard for agent interoperability
- Enables secure, standardized agent interactions
- Cross-platform compatibility

**NLWeb Protocol**
- Potential "HTML for the agentic web"
- Enables websites to provide conversational interfaces
- Natural language as the primary interaction paradigm

### 4. Key Technologies and Tools

**Development Frameworks**
- Semantic Kernel for AI integration
- AutoGen for multi-agent systems
- Microsoft Entra Agent ID for authentication
- Copilot Tuning for customization

**Security and Identity**
- Enterprise-grade authentication
- Agent identity management
- Secure data handling protocols

## Scientific and Business Applications

### Microsoft Discovery Platform
- Accelerating scientific research through AI
- Agent-assisted hypothesis generation
- Automated experiment design
- Data analysis and pattern recognition

### Business Process Automation
- **Sales Operations**: Lead prioritization, proposal creation
- **Client Management**: Insights generation, relationship tracking
- **Healthcare**: Workflow optimization, patient care coordination
- **Enterprise Functions**: Cross-functional process automation

## Adoption Metrics (2025)

- **GitHub Copilot**: 15 million developers
- **Copilot Studio**: 230,000 organizations
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot**: 90% of Fortune 500 companies
- **Enterprise Agent Adoption**: Rapidly accelerating across industries

## Implications for Software Development

### Shift in Development Paradigm
- Move from traditional coding to agent orchestration
- Emphasis on declarative rather than imperative programming
- Focus on defining goals rather than implementation details

### New Skill Requirements
- Agent design and orchestration
- Prompt engineering and tuning
- Multi-agent system architecture
- AI safety and governance

### Infrastructure Evolution
- Agent-ready APIs and services
- Conversational interfaces as standard
- Semantic understanding built into systems
- Real-time agent collaboration protocols

## Key Takeaways for HELIX Workflow

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Future workflows need native support for multiple specialized agents working in concert
2. **Asynchronous Operations**: Agents should operate asynchronously, not just in real-time interactions
3. **Open Standards**: Adoption of protocols like MCP ensures interoperability
4. **Enterprise Readiness**: Security, governance, and observability must be built-in from the start
5. **Conversational Paradigm**: Natural language becomes the primary interface for development workflows

## Future Outlook

Microsoft's vision suggests that by 2025 and beyond:
- AI agents will be fundamental to all software development
- The distinction between development and operations will further blur
- Natural language will become the primary programming interface
- Multi-agent collaboration will solve increasingly complex problems
- Open standards will enable a true "agentic web" ecosystem

This transformation requires updating development workflows like HELIX to embrace multi-agent orchestration, asynchronous operations, and conversational interfaces as core capabilities rather than add-ons.
