# Architectural Constraints

## Overview

Architectural constraints in CDP serve as guardrails that prevent system complexity from growing beyond manageable limits. Like medical protocols that limit dosages and procedures to safe ranges, these constraints ensure development remains sustainable and maintainable.

## Resource Constraints

### Maximum 3 Concurrent Features

**Rationale**: 
Human cognitive capacity is limited. Context switching between multiple complex features leads to decreased quality, increased errors, and slower overall delivery.

**Implementation**:
- Feature work is tracked in a dedicated project board
- No more than 3 features can be in "In Progress" status simultaneously
- Features must reach "Done" status before new features can begin
- Emergency fixes are exempt but must be prioritized and tracked separately

**Feature Definition**:
A feature is defined as work that:
- Affects user-facing functionality
- Requires more than 40 hours of development time
- Involves multiple system components
- Requires new architectural decisions

**Monitoring**:
```bash
# Check current feature count
ddx diagnose --features
# Output: 2/3 concurrent features in progress
```

**Enforcement**:
- Project management tools automatically block new feature creation when limit is reached
- Daily standups must review feature progress and completion
- Weekly architecture reviews assess feature scope and complexity

### Maximum Complexity Score 10

**Rationale**:
Code complexity directly correlates with bug density, maintenance cost, and developer cognitive load. Setting hard limits prevents the accumulation of technical debt.

**Complexity Metrics**:

1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Number of independent paths through code
2. **Cognitive Complexity**: Difficulty of understanding code flow
3. **Nesting Depth**: Maximum levels of nested control structures
4. **Function Length**: Number of lines in a single function
5. **Class Coupling**: Number of dependencies between classes

**Scoring System**:
```yaml
complexity_score:
  cyclomatic_complexity:
    weight: 3
    max_value: 10
  cognitive_complexity:
    weight: 2
    max_value: 15
  nesting_depth:
    weight: 1
    max_value: 4
  function_length:
    weight: 1
    max_value: 50
  class_coupling:
    weight: 2
    max_value: 8

# Formula: (cyclomatic * 3 + cognitive * 2 + nesting * 1 + length * 1 + coupling * 2) / 9
# Max score: 10 (normalized)
```

**Measurement Tools**:
```bash
# Go
gocyclo -over 10 ./...
golangci-lint run --enable=gocognit,nestif,funlen

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm run complexity -- --max-complexity=10

# Python  
radon cc --min=C --max=F src/
```

**Refactoring Triggers**:
- Score > 8: Schedule refactoring within current sprint
- Score > 9: Refactoring required before merge
- Score = 10: Code must be refactored before review

**Example Refactoring**:
```go
// Bad: High complexity (score > 10)
func ProcessOrder(order Order) error {
    if order.Items == nil || len(order.Items) == 0 {
        return errors.New("no items")
    }
    
    total := 0.0
    for _, item := range order.Items {
        if item.Price < 0 {
            return errors.New("negative price")
        }
        if item.Quantity <= 0 {
            return errors.New("invalid quantity")
        }
        total += item.Price * float64(item.Quantity)
    }
    
    if order.Customer.Type == "premium" {
        if total > 1000 {
            total *= 0.85 // 15% discount
        } else if total > 500 {
            total *= 0.90 // 10% discount
        } else if total > 100 {
            total *= 0.95 // 5% discount
        }
    } else if order.Customer.Type == "regular" {
        if total > 500 {
            total *= 0.95 // 5% discount
        }
    }
    
    // ... more complex logic
    return nil
}

// Good: Refactored for lower complexity (score < 8)
func ProcessOrder(order Order) error {
    if err := validateOrder(order); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    total := calculateOrderTotal(order.Items)
    discountedTotal := applyCustomerDiscount(total, order.Customer)
    
    return finalizeOrder(order, discountedTotal)
}

func validateOrder(order Order) error {
    if order.Items == nil || len(order.Items) == 0 {
        return errors.New("no items")
    }
    return validateOrderItems(order.Items)
}

func calculateOrderTotal(items []Item) float64 {
    total := 0.0
    for _, item := range items {
        total += item.Price * float64(item.Quantity)
    }
    return total
}

func applyCustomerDiscount(total float64, customer Customer) float64 {
    discountRate := getDiscountRate(customer.Type, total)
    return total * (1.0 - discountRate)
}
```

### Minimum 80% Test Coverage

**Rationale**:
High test coverage correlates with fewer production bugs and easier refactoring. 80% provides a practical balance between safety and development speed.

**Coverage Types**:

1. **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed during tests
2. **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of conditional branches tested
3. **Function Coverage**: Percentage of functions called during tests
4. **Statement Coverage**: Percentage of statements executed during tests

**Measurement**:
```bash
# Go
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm run test -- --coverage
npm run coverage:report

# Python
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=80
```

**Coverage Requirements by Component Type**:
```yaml
coverage_requirements:
  business_logic: 90%    # Core business rules
  api_endpoints: 85%     # External interfaces
  utilities: 80%         # Helper functions
  ui_components: 75%     # User interface elements
  infrastructure: 70%    # Database, external services
```

**Exclusions**:
- Generated code
- Third-party integrations (with mocks required)
- Configuration files
- Trivial getters/setters
- Main functions and entry points

**Example Coverage Report**:
```
=== Coverage Report ===

----------------------------------------
TOTAL                    135     16    88%

Coverage requirement: 80% ✓
Files below threshold: src/payment.go (74%)

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Automated Enforcement

**Pre-commit Hooks**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check concurrent features limit
if ! ddx diagnose --features --max=3; then
  echo "❌ Too many concurrent features in progress"
  exit 1
fi

# Check complexity scores
if ! make complexity-check; then
  echo "❌ Code complexity exceeds limits"
  exit 1
fi

# Check test coverage
if ! make coverage-check; then
  echo "❌ Test coverage below 80%"
  exit 1
fi
```

**CI/CD Pipeline Gates**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/constraints.yml
name: Constraint Validation

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate-constraints:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Check Feature Limits
        run: ddx diagnose --features --max=3
        
      - name: Complexity Analysis
        run: make complexity-check

        run: make security-scan
        
      - name: Performance Test
        run: make performance-test
```

## Constraint Evolution

### Adjustment Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather metrics on current constraint effectiveness
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess how constraints affect development velocity and quality
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Discuss proposed changes with development teams
4. **Pilot Testing**: Test new constraints with a subset of projects
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement changes incrementally across all projects

### Historical Changes

```yaml
constraint_history:
  v1.0:
    max_features: 5
    max_complexity: 15
    min_coverage: 70%
    
  v1.1:
    max_features: 4  # Reduced due to context switching issues
    max_complexity: 12
    min_coverage: 75%
    
  v2.0:
    max_features: 3  # Current values
    max_complexity: 10
    min_coverage: 80%
```

### Future Considerations

- **Adaptive Constraints**: Automatically adjust based on team maturity and project complexity
- **Context-Aware Limits**: Different constraints for different project types or phases
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML to predict optimal constraint values
- **Real-time Optimization**: Dynamic constraint adjustment based on current system load and team capacity
