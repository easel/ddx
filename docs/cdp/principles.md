# CDP Principles in Detail

## The Three Immutable Laws

### 1. Specification Before Implementation

**Definition**: Every piece of functionality must be completely specified before any implementation work begins.

**Implementation**:
- **Requirements Documentation**: Clear, testable requirements written in plain language
- **Technical Specifications**: Detailed design documents including APIs, data models, and architectural decisions
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable conditions that define when work is complete
- **Interface Contracts**: Explicit definitions of all system boundaries and interactions

**Examples**:

```yaml
# Good: Complete specification
Feature: User Authentication
Requirements:
  - Users must be able to log in with email and password
  - Failed login attempts must be logged and rate-limited
  - Sessions must expire after 24 hours of inactivity
Acceptance Criteria:
  - Login form validates email format
  - Password must be at least 8 characters
  - Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts = 15 minute lockout
  - Session cookie has 24-hour sliding expiration
```

```yaml
# Bad: Incomplete specification
Feature: User Authentication
Requirements:
  - Add login functionality
  - Make it secure
```

**Validation Methods**:
- Specification reviews with stakeholders
- Walkthrough sessions with implementation teams
- Prototype validation where complexity is high
- Requirements traceability matrices

### 2. Validation Before Deployment

**Definition**: All code must pass comprehensive validation before deployment to any environment, including development branches.

**Validation Layers**:

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component behavior validation
2. **Integration Testing**: Component interaction validation
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end functionality validation
4. **Performance Testing**: Non-functional requirement validation
5. **Security Testing**: Vulnerability and compliance validation
6. **User Acceptance Testing**: Stakeholder requirement validation

**Implementation Process**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Complete] --> B[Unit Tests]
    B --> C[Integration Tests]
    C --> D[System Tests]
    D --> E[Performance Tests]
    E --> F[Security Tests]
    F --> G[UAT]
    G --> H[Deployment Ready]
    
    B --> I[Failed] --> J[Fix and Retry]
    C --> I
    D --> I
    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> I
    J --> B
```

**Quality Gates**:
- 80% minimum test coverage
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance within established SLAs
- All acceptance criteria validated
- Code review approval from at least 2 peers

**Examples**:

```bash
# Automated validation pipeline
make validate
├── lint-check       # Static analysis
├── unit-tests       # Component validation  
├── integration-tests # System interaction validation
├── security-scan    # Vulnerability assessment
├── performance-test # Load and stress testing
└── coverage-report  # Coverage analysis
```

### 3. Contracts Before Integration

**Definition**: All interfaces between system components must be explicitly defined and agreed upon before integration begins.

**Contract Types**:

1. **API Contracts**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC interface definitions
2. **Data Contracts**: Database schemas, message formats, data validation rules
3. **Service Contracts**: SLA definitions, error handling, retry policies
4. **Event Contracts**: Event schemas, delivery guarantees, ordering requirements

**Implementation Standards**:

```yaml
# API Contract Example
UserService:
  endpoints:
    - path: /api/v1/users/{id}
      method: GET
      parameters:
        id: 
          type: integer
          required: true
          validation: positive
      responses:
        200:
          schema: User
          description: User found
        404:
          schema: Error
          description: User not found
        500:
          schema: Error
          description: Server error
      sla:
        response_time: 200ms
        availability: 99.9%
```

```go
// Service Contract Example
type UserRepository interface {
    GetUser(ctx context.Context, id int) (*User, error)
    CreateUser(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    UpdateUser(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    DeleteUser(ctx context.Context, id int) error
}

// Error Contract
type UserError struct {
    Code    ErrorCode `json:"code"`
    Message string    `json:"message"`
    Details map[string]interface{} `json:"details,omitempty"`
}
```

**Contract Evolution**:
- Semantic versioning for all contracts
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Deprecation policies and timelines
- Migration strategies for breaking changes

## Development Values

### Agile Principles in Practice

**1. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**
- Daily standups focused on problem-solving, not status reporting
- Pair programming and mob programming sessions
- Direct communication channels between team members
- Regular retrospectives with actionable improvements

**2. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**
- Documentation serves the software, not vice versa
- Automated tests as living documentation
- Code that is self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- Just-enough documentation to enable understanding and maintenance

**3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**
- Regular stakeholder demos and feedback sessions
- User story writing workshops with business stakeholders
- Continuous user research and feedback integration
- Flexible scope management within sprint boundaries

**4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**
- Sprint planning that accounts for uncertainty
- Regular backlog refinement and priority adjustment
- Technical debt management as part of regular planning
- Architecture that supports changing requirements

### Engineering Principles Application

**SOLID Principles**:

```go
// Single Responsibility Principle
type UserValidator struct{}
func (v *UserValidator) ValidateEmail(email string) error { /* ... */ }

type UserRepository struct{}
func (r *UserRepository) Save(user User) error { /* ... */ }

// Open/Closed Principle
type PaymentProcessor interface {
    Process(payment Payment) error
}

type CreditCardProcessor struct{}
func (c *CreditCardProcessor) Process(payment Payment) error { /* ... */ }

type PayPalProcessor struct{}
func (p *PayPalProcessor) Process(payment Payment) error { /* ... */ }
```

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
- Shared utility functions and libraries
- Configuration management systems
- Template-based code generation
- Common error handling patterns

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**:
- Feature flags for experimental functionality
- Minimal viable implementations
- Iterative enhancement over upfront complexity
- Regular architecture reviews to remove unused code

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**:
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Clear, descriptive naming over comments
- Simple algorithms over clever optimizations
- Explicit error handling over silent failures
