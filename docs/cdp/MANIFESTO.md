# Clinical Development Protocol (CDP) Manifesto

## Core Philosophy

The Clinical Development Protocol (CDP) applies medical discipline to software development. Just as clinical medicine follows rigorous protocols to ensure patient safety and treatment efficacy, CDP establishes systematic processes to ensure code quality, system reliability, and development predictability.

## The Three Immutable Laws

### 1. Specification Before Implementation
No code shall be written without a complete specification. Every feature, function, and system component must be fully documented before implementation begins.

**Rationale**: In medicine, no procedure begins without a thorough understanding of the patient's condition and treatment plan. Similarly, no development work should start without clear requirements and specifications.

### 2. Validation Before Deployment
All implementations must pass comprehensive validation before deployment to any environment, including development branches.

**Rationale**: Clinical treatments undergo rigorous testing before patient application. Our code must undergo equivalent scrutiny before it affects any system.

### 3. Contracts Before Integration
All system interfaces must be defined by explicit contracts before any integration occurs.

**Rationale**: Medical specialists communicate through standardized protocols and documentation. System components must communicate through well-defined interfaces.

## Architectural Constraints

### Resource Limits
- **Maximum 3 Concurrent Features**: No more than 3 features may be in active development simultaneously
- **Maximum Complexity Score 10**: No module may exceed a complexity score of 10
- **Minimum 80% Test Coverage**: All code must maintain at least 80% test coverage

### Quality Gates
- All code must pass static analysis
- All tests must pass before merge
- All documentation must be current and accurate
- All interfaces must be versioned and backward compatible

## Development Values

### Agile Principles
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### Engineering Principles
- **SOLID**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid

## The Clinical Method

### 1. Diagnose
Thoroughly analyze the problem space, requirements, and constraints before proposing solutions.

### 2. Prescribe
Define the treatment plan with clear specifications, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

### 3. Treat
Implement the solution following established protocols and best practices.

### 4. Monitor
Continuously observe the system's response to changes through metrics and feedback.

### 5. Release
Deploy validated solutions through controlled, staged processes.

### 6. Follow-up
Conduct post-deployment reviews to assess effectiveness and identify improvements.

## Enforcement

CDP is not merely aspirational - it is enforced through:

- **Automated Validation**: Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment gates
- **Code Review Requirements**: Mandatory peer review for all changes
- **Architectural Review Boards**: Regular assessment of system design and complexity
- **Retrospective Analysis**: Regular examination of development practices and outcomes

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Clear expectations and processes
- Reduced cognitive load through standardized practices
- Higher confidence in code quality
- Better work-life balance through predictable development cycles

### For Organizations
- Reduced technical debt
- Increased system reliability
- Faster feature delivery through reduced rework
- Lower maintenance costs

### For Users
- More reliable software
- Faster bug fixes
- Better user experience
- Consistent feature quality

## Commitment

By adopting CDP, we commit to:
- Prioritizing system health over feature velocity
- Maintaining discipline in our development practices
- Continuously improving our processes and tools
- Sharing knowledge and best practices across teams

Just as medical professionals take the Hippocratic Oath to "first, do no harm," we pledge to apply clinical rigor to our development practices, ensuring that every line of code serves the greater good of system reliability, maintainability, and user satisfaction.
