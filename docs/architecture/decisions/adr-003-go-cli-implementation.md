# ADR-002: Implement DDX CLI Using Go

**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: DDX Development Team  
**Technical Story**: Select implementation language and framework for the DDX command-line interface

## Context

### Problem Statement
DDX requires a command-line interface that can:
- Run on multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Execute Git commands reliably
- Manipulate filesystem operations safely
- Parse and process YAML configurations
- Provide fast execution with minimal startup time
- Distribute as a single binary with no runtime dependencies

### Forces at Play
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Must work identically across operating systems
- **Distribution Simplicity**: Users want single-file installation
- **Performance**: CLI tools need instant response times
- **Developer Productivity**: Need rapid development and maintenance
- **Ecosystem**: Must integrate with Git and filesystem operations
- **Community**: Need access to libraries and tooling
- **Learning Curve**: Team expertise and onboarding considerations

### Constraints
- No runtime dependencies allowed (rules out interpreted languages)
- Must compile to native binary for each platform
- Startup time must be < 100ms for simple commands
- Binary size should be reasonable (< 50MB)
- Must handle concurrent operations safely
- Need robust error handling for system operations

## Decision

### Chosen Approach
Implement the DDX CLI using Go (Golang) with the Cobra framework for command structure and Viper for configuration management.

### Rationale
- **Single Binary Distribution**: Go compiles to self-contained binaries with no runtime dependencies
- **Cross-platform Support**: Excellent cross-compilation support for all target platforms
- **Performance**: Fast startup time and execution speed suitable for CLI tools
- **Robust Standard Library**: Built-in support for OS operations, process management, and networking
- **Cobra Framework**: Industry-standard CLI framework used by Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub CLI
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines enable efficient parallel operations
- **Error Handling**: Explicit error handling promotes reliability
- **Growing CLI Ecosystem**: Many successful CLI tools built with Go

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Rust
**Description**: Implement CLI using Rust for maximum performance and safety

**Pros**:
- Zero-cost abstractions and maximum performance
- Memory safety guarantees without garbage collection
- Excellent cross-compilation support
- Growing ecosystem with Clap for CLI parsing
- Small binary sizes possible

**Cons**:
- Steep learning curve for the team
- Slower development velocity
- Smaller talent pool for maintenance
- Complex async/await model
- Longer compile times impacting development

**Why rejected**: The performance benefits don't outweigh the significantly slower development velocity and steeper learning curve for the team

### Option 2: Node.js/TypeScript
**Description**: Build CLI using Node.js with TypeScript for type safety

**Pros**:
- Large ecosystem of packages
- Familiar to many developers
- Fast development iteration
- Excellent JSON/YAML handling
- Good testing frameworks

**Cons**:
- Requires Node.js runtime installation
- Slow startup time (200-500ms)
- Complex distribution (node_modules bloat)
- Platform-specific binary compilation complicated
- Runtime errors possible despite TypeScript

**Why rejected**: Runtime dependency violates the zero-dependency requirement, and startup performance is inadequate for a CLI tool

### Option 3: Python with PyInstaller
**Description**: Develop in Python and bundle to executables using PyInstaller

**Pros**:
- Rapid development
- Extensive standard library
- Large ecosystem
- Readable and maintainable code
- Good for scripting and automation

**Cons**:
- Large bundled executables (30-100MB)
- Slow startup time when bundled
- PyInstaller compatibility issues
- Anti-virus false positives common
- Performance limitations for I/O operations

**Why rejected**: Bundle size and startup performance issues, plus distribution complexity with PyInstaller

### Option 4: Bash/Shell Script
**Description**: Implement as pure shell scripts for maximum portability

**Pros**:
- No compilation needed
- Direct Git and filesystem integration
- Minimal overhead
- Works everywhere Bash is available
- Simple to modify and debug

**Cons**:
- Windows compatibility requires WSL or Git Bash
- Complex logic becomes unmaintainable
- No type safety or modern language features
- Testing is difficult
- String manipulation is error-prone
- No standard packaging/distribution

**Why rejected**: Windows compatibility issues and maintainability concerns for complex logic

### Option 5: C/C++
**Description**: Use C or C++ for maximum control and performance

**Pros**:
- Maximum performance potential
- Smallest possible binaries
- Complete system control
- No garbage collection overhead
- Mature tooling

**Cons**:
- Manual memory management complexity
- Slow development velocity
- Platform-specific code required
- Security vulnerabilities more likely
- Complex build system
- String handling is error-prone

**Why rejected**: Development complexity and security concerns outweigh performance benefits for this use case

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Fast Execution**: Sub-100ms startup time achieved
- **Easy Distribution**: Single binary installation via curl/wget
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Same binary behavior across all platforms
- **Reliable Operations**: Strong standard library for system operations
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Can leverage packages like Cobra, Viper, Survey
- **Maintainability**: Clear, typed code with explicit error handling
- **Hiring Pool**: Growing number of Go developers available

### Negative Consequences
- **Binary Size**: Go binaries are larger than C/Rust equivalents (10-20MB)
- **Garbage Collection**: GC pauses possible (though negligible for CLI)
- **Generics Limited**: Go's generics are relatively new and limited
- **Error Verbosity**: Explicit error handling can be verbose
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Go idioms and patterns

### Neutral Consequences
- **Opinionated Language**: Go's conventions reduce style debates
- **Limited Metaprogramming**: Less flexible but more predictable
- **Module System**: Go modules for dependency management
- **Testing Built-in**: Standard testing framework included

## Implementation

### Required Changes
- Set up Go development environment
- Implement Cobra command structure
- Integrate Viper for configuration
- Create build pipeline for multi-platform binaries
- Establish testing patterns
- Document Go coding standards

### Migration Strategy
Not applicable - new implementation

### Success Metrics
- **Startup Time**: < 100ms for `ddx --help`
- **Binary Size**: < 20MB for each platform
- **Build Time**: < 30 seconds for all platforms
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% for critical paths
- **Cross-platform Tests**: Pass on all target platforms
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB for typical operations

## Compliance

### Security Requirements
- No dynamic code execution
- Secure handling of Git credentials
- Input validation for all user inputs
- No phone-home telemetry

### Performance Requirements
- Instant response for local operations
- Efficient file I/O for large projects
- Minimal memory footprint
- Concurrent operations where beneficial

### Regulatory Requirements
- MIT license compatibility
- No cryptographic restrictions
- Open source distribution

## Monitoring and Review

### Key Indicators to Watch
- Binary size growth over time
- Startup time regression
- Memory usage patterns
- Dependency update frequency
- Build time trends
- Platform-specific bug reports

### Review Date
Q3 2025 - After 9 months of production use

### Review Triggers
- Go 2.0 release (if it happens)
- Binary size exceeds 30MB
- Startup time exceeds 200ms
- Major security vulnerability in Go runtime
- Team velocity concerns

## Related Decisions

## Notes

Go has proven to be an excellent choice for CLI tools, as evidenced by successful projects like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitHub CLI. The combination of Go with Cobra provides a robust foundation that balances development velocity with performance.

The decision to use Go aligns with the medical metaphor - like medical instruments, the CLI tool needs to be reliable, precise, and immediately available when needed. Go's compilation to a single binary is like having a self-contained medical device that works anywhere without external dependencies.

Key insight: While Rust might offer marginally better performance and smaller binaries, Go's developer productivity and ecosystem maturity make it the pragmatic choice for a tool that needs to evolve quickly based on user feedback.
