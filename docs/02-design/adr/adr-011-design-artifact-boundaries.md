# ADR-011: Design Phase Artifact Boundaries

**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: Proposed
**Deciders**: DDX Architecture Team
**Related Feature(s)**: FEAT-005 (Workflow Execution), Design Phase
**Confidence Level**: High

## Context

The Design phase of workflows (particularly Helix) uses three distinct artifact types: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), Technical Spikes, and Solution Designs. Without clear boundaries, teams struggle to determine which artifact type to use, leading to:
- ADRs documenting implementation details rather than architectural decisions
- Tech Spikes duplicating ADR rationale instead of evaluating technologies
- Solution Designs repeating technology evaluations instead of focusing on implementation
- Confusion about where to document different types of decisions

### Problem Statement

We need clear boundaries and selection criteria for Design phase artifacts to ensure each serves its intended purpose and maintains appropriate scope. Currently, developers waste time debating which artifact to use, and important decisions end up in the wrong place, making them hard to find and maintain.

### Current State

The Helix workflow provides templates for ADRs, Tech Spikes, and Solution Designs, but lacks clear guidance on when to use each. This results in:
- Inconsistent documentation practices across teams
- Difficulty finding specific decisions or evaluations
- Overlapping content between artifact types
- Incorrect review and update cycles

### Requirements Driving This Decision
- Clear separation between architectural decisions and implementation details
- Traceable flow from decisions through technology selection to implementation
- Different review and update cycles for each artifact type
- Reusability of artifacts across projects and teams
- Alignment with industry standards (ADR methodology)
- Support for both AI-assisted and manual workflow completion

## Decision

We will establish clear boundaries between Design phase artifacts based on their purpose in the decision-making flow:
- **ADRs**: Document fundamental architectural decisions (WHY)
- **Tech Spikes**: Evaluate and select specific technologies (WHAT)
- **Solution Designs**: Define implementation approaches (HOW)

### Key Points
- Each artifact type has a specific scope and purpose
- Artifacts flow sequentially when all are needed: ADR → Tech Spike → Solution Design
- Not all decisions require all three artifacts
- Clear selection criteria prevent scope creep
- Each artifact should reference related artifacts for traceability

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Single Artifact Type for All Decisions
**Description**: Use only ADRs for all design decisions

**Pros**:
- Simpler to understand
- Single location for all decisions
- Consistent format

**Cons**:
- ADRs become bloated with implementation details
- Technology evaluations buried in decision rationale
- Difficult to update technology choices without revising entire decision
- Violates ADR best practices

**Evaluation**: Rejected - loses important distinctions between decision types

### Option 2: Two Artifact Types (Decisions and Implementations)
**Description**: Combine Tech Spikes with ADRs, keep Solution Designs separate

**Pros**:
- Fewer artifact types to manage
- Technology selection part of decision
- Clear implementation separation

**Cons**:
- Technology evaluation details clutter architectural decisions
- Harder to reuse technology evaluations
- Different update cycles for decisions and technology choices

**Evaluation**: Rejected - technology evaluation is a distinct activity

### Option 3: Three Distinct Artifact Types (Selected)
**Description**: Separate ADRs, Tech Spikes, and Solution Designs with clear boundaries

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Appropriate detail level for each type
- Independent evolution and review cycles
- Reusable technology evaluations
- Aligns with industry practices

**Cons**:
- More artifact types to understand
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries
- Potential for gaps between artifacts

**Evaluation**: Selected - provides optimal separation and reusability

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Clear Selection**: Decision tree eliminates confusion about artifact choice
- **Appropriate Review**: Each artifact type reviewed at appropriate frequency
- **Better Reusability**: Tech Spikes can be reused across projects
- **Cleaner History**: Version control shows focused changes
- **Faster Discovery**: Easier to find specific decisions or evaluations
- **Quality Improvement**: Each artifact can focus on its core purpose

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need to understand three artifact types
- **Potential Over-documentation**: Risk of creating unnecessary artifacts
- **Relationship Management**: Must maintain cross-references between artifacts
- **Initial Overhead**: Deciding which artifact type takes time initially

### Neutral Consequences
- **More Files**: Three files where one might have sufficed
- **Process Change**: Existing workflows need updating
- **Tooling Updates**: CLI tools should support artifact selection

## Implementation Impact

### Development Impact
- **Effort**: Low - Update templates and documentation
- **Time**: 1 week for documentation and template updates
- **Skills Required**: Technical writing, workflow design

### Operational Impact
- **Performance**: No runtime impact - documentation only
- **Scalability**: Improves as projects grow
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain focused artifacts

### Security Impact
- No direct security impact
- Better documentation of security decisions in appropriate artifacts

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Teams ignore boundaries | Medium | Medium | Provide clear examples and decision tree |
| Over-documentation | Low | Low | Review process to catch unnecessary artifacts |
| Gaps between artifacts | Low | Medium | Cross-reference requirements in templates |
| Inconsistent adoption | Medium | Medium | Training and automated validation |

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Workflow template system must support three artifact types
- Documentation generation should handle cross-references

### Decision Dependencies
- ADR-001: Workflow Structure (establishes template-prompt-pattern architecture)
- FEAT-005: Workflow Execution Engine (implements workflow system)

## Validation

### How We'll Know This Was Right
- 80% reduction in "which artifact?" discussions
- Technology evaluations reused 3+ times on average
- ADRs remain stable while implementations evolve
- New team members understand artifact purposes within 1 day
- Search time for decisions reduced by 50%

### Review Triggers
This decision should be reviewed if:
- New artifact types are proposed
- Industry standards for documentation change
- Teams consistently struggle with boundaries
- Workflow automation capabilities change significantly

## Notes

### Artifact Boundary Definitions

#### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
**Purpose**: Document decisions that are expensive to change

**Scope**:
- Fundamental architectural patterns (monolith vs microservices)
- Protocol and interface choices (REST vs GraphQL)
- Data strategy decisions (SQL vs NoSQL)
- System boundaries and separation (internal vs external APIs)
- Major technology categories (containerization, cloud provider)

**Examples**:
- "Use GraphQL for internal APIs"
- "Separate internal and external API surfaces"
- "Adopt event-driven architecture"
- "Use containerization for all services"

**NOT ADRs**:
- Specific library selections (→ Tech Spike)
- Implementation patterns (→ Solution Design)
- Configuration details (→ Implementation Guide)
- Version selections (→ Tech Spike)

#### Technical Spikes
**Purpose**: Evaluate and select specific technologies to implement architectural decisions

**Scope**:
- Library/framework comparison
- Performance validation
- Integration complexity assessment
- Feasibility studies
- Version compatibility testing

**Examples**:
- "Caliban vs Sangria for Scala GraphQL"
- "Redis vs Hazelcast for distributed cache"
- "Terraform vs Pulumi for Infrastructure as Code"
- "React vs Vue for frontend framework"

**NOT Tech Spikes**:
- Fundamental approach decisions (→ ADR)
- Implementation architecture (→ Solution Design)
- Production configuration (→ Implementation Guide)
- Best practices documentation (→ Solution Design)

#### Solution Designs
**Purpose**: Define how to implement architectural decisions using selected technologies

**Scope**:
- Component architecture
- Integration patterns
- Data flow design
- Deployment architecture
- Error handling strategies
- Security implementation

**Examples**:
- "GraphQL federation with Apollo Gateway"
- "Multi-tenant database isolation strategy"
- "Event processing pipeline implementation"
- "Zero-downtime deployment process"

**NOT Solution Designs**:
- Why we chose an approach (→ ADR)
- Which technology to use (→ Tech Spike)
- Step-by-step procedures (→ Implementation Guide)
- Configuration values (→ Implementation Guide)

### Selection Decision Tree

```
Start: What are you documenting?
│
├─ Is this a fundamental, expensive-to-change decision?
│  └─ YES → Create an ADR
│
├─ Are you evaluating specific technologies/libraries?
│  └─ YES → Create a Tech Spike
│
├─ Are you defining implementation architecture?
│  └─ YES → Create a Solution Design
│
└─ Are you documenting procedures or configuration?
   └─ YES → Create an Implementation Guide (Build phase)
```

### Artifact Flow Example
