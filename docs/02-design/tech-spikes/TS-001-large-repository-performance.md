# Tech Spike: Large Repository Performance Investigation

**Spike ID**: TS-001
**Related Features**: FEAT-001, FEAT-004, FEAT-005
**Time Box**: 3 days
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-14

## Context

Multiple solution designs assume DDX can handle large repositories efficiently, but we need to validate performance characteristics and identify scalability limits for:

- Asset discovery and listing across thousands of files (FEAT-001)
- Git subtree operations on large repositories (FEAT-002)
- Workflow discovery with 1000+ workflows (FEAT-005)

## Technical Question

**Primary**: What are the performance characteristics and scalability limits when DDX operates on large repositories (1GB+, 10,000+ files)?

**Specific Sub-Questions**:
1. How does asset discovery time scale with repository size?
2. What is the impact of git subtree operations on large repositories?
3. Can workflow discovery maintain <30s response time with 1000+ workflows?
4. What are the memory usage patterns for large repository operations?
5. Do we need pagination or lazy loading for asset listings?

## Success Criteria

By the end of this spike, we must have:
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for repositories of varying sizes (10MB, 100MB, 1GB)
- [ ] Memory usage profiles for large repository operations
- [ ] Identification of performance bottlenecks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Recommendations for pagination/lazy loading implementation
- [ ] Decision on repository size limits and warnings

## Investigation Scope

### In Scope
- Asset discovery performance across different repository sizes
- Git subtree performance with large upstream repositories
- Memory usage patterns for file system operations
- Workflow catalog loading and search performance
- Caching strategies for improving performance

### Out of Scope
- Network bandwidth optimization
- Database-backed solutions
- Complex indexing systems (focus on file-based solutions)
- GUI performance considerations

## Investigation Plan

### Day 1: Benchmark Setup and Baseline
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Create test repositories of different sizes:
  - Small: 10MB, 100 files
  - Medium: 100MB, 1,000 files
  - Large: 1GB, 10,000 files
  - Extra Large: 2GB, 20,000 files
- Implement basic benchmarking harness
- Establish baseline performance metrics

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Benchmark current asset discovery implementation
- Profile memory usage patterns
- Document baseline performance characteristics

### Day 2: Performance Analysis
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Analyze git subtree performance on large repositories
- Test workflow discovery scenarios with large workflow catalogs
- Identify performance bottlenecks using Go profiling tools

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Experiment with caching strategies:
  - In-memory caching
  - File-based caching
  - Lazy loading approaches
- Measure impact of different optimization strategies

### Day 3: Optimization and Recommendations
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Implement most promising optimization approaches
- Re-run benchmarks to validate improvements
- Test edge cases (empty repositories, single large files, etc.)

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Document findings and recommendations
- Create implementation guidance for solution designs
- Identify areas needing architectural changes

## Investigation Methodology

### Benchmarking Approach
```go
type RepositoryBenchmark struct {
    Size        string // "small", "medium", "large", "xlarge"
    FileCount   int
    TotalSize   int64
    AssetTypes  []string

    // Performance metrics
    DiscoveryTime     time.Duration
    MemoryUsage      int64
    CacheHitRatio    float64
}

// Test scenarios
func BenchmarkAssetDiscovery(b *testing.B) {
    scenarios := []RepositoryBenchmark{
        {Size: "small", FileCount: 100, TotalSize: 10 * MB},
        {Size: "medium", FileCount: 1000, TotalSize: 100 * MB},
        {Size: "large", FileCount: 10000, TotalSize: 1 * GB},
        {Size: "xlarge", FileCount: 20000, TotalSize: 2 * GB},
    }

    for _, scenario := range scenarios {
        b.Run(scenario.Size, func(b *testing.B) {
            // Benchmark implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Memory Profiling
- Use Go's built-in `pprof` for memory profiling
- Monitor heap allocations during operations
- Identify memory leaks and excessive allocations
- Test garbage collection impact on performance

### Test Repository Structure
```
test-repos/
├── small/           # 10MB, 100 files
│   ├── templates/   # 30 files
│   ├── patterns/    # 30 files
│   ├── prompts/     # 30 files
│   └── workflows/   # 10 files
├── medium/          # 100MB, 1,000 files
│   └── [same structure, scaled up]
├── large/           # 1GB, 10,000 files
│   └── [same structure, scaled up]
└── xlarge/          # 2GB, 20,000 files
    └── [same structure, scaled up]
```

## Expected Findings

### Hypotheses to Test
1. **File System Performance**: Asset discovery time scales linearly with file count
2. **Memory Usage**: Memory usage scales with active file count, not total repository size
3. **Git Performance**: Git subtree operations slow significantly on repositories >500MB
4. **Caching Effectiveness**: File metadata caching reduces discovery time by >50%
5. **Workflow Discovery**: Search performance degrades after 1000 workflows without indexing

### Potential Bottlenecks
- File system traversal for asset discovery
- Git operations on large repositories
- Memory allocation for large file listings
- Lack of indexing for workflow search
- Synchronous vs asynchronous operations

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance unacceptable for large repos | Medium | High | Implement pagination, lazy loading |
| Memory usage exceeds reasonable limits | Medium | Medium | Optimize data structures, add streaming |
| Git subtree too slow for large repos | Low | High | Repository size warnings, alternatives |
| Workflow discovery doesn't scale | Medium | Medium | Add search indexing |
