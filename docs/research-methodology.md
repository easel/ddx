# HELIX Research Methodology

A comprehensive guide to incorporating research and technical investigation into the HELIX workflow.

## Overview

The HELIX workflow now includes research and technical investigation capabilities to handle uncertainty and risk before committing to detailed design and implementation. This document provides teams with practical guidance on when to use research artifacts, how to execute investigations effectively, and how to integrate findings into standard HELIX phases.

## Research Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: All decisions should be informed by concrete evidence rather than assumptions
2. **Time-Boxed Investigation**: Research activities must have strict time boundaries to prevent analysis paralysis
3. **Actionable Outcomes**: Every research activity must produce actionable insights that inform project decisions
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Research should focus on reducing the highest-impact uncertainties first
5. **Integration-Focused**: Research findings must directly integrate into Frame and Design artifacts

### When Research is Valuable

Research artifacts should be used when:

- **High Uncertainty**: Significant unknowns about problem, users, market, or technical approach
- **High Stakes**: Large investment, strategic importance, or high failure cost
- **Novel Domain**: Unfamiliar problem space, market, or technology
- **Assumption-Heavy**: Key decisions based on unvalidated assumptions
- **Stakeholder Disagreement**: Different views on problem definition or approach

### When Research is NOT Needed

Avoid research when:

- Problem and solution are well-understood with precedents
- Small investment with low failure cost
- Time constraints make investigation impractical
- Sufficient evidence already exists from other sources
- Research would delay decisions without material impact

## Research Artifact Types

### Frame Phase Research

## Decision Framework

### Research Trigger Assessment

Use this framework to determine if research is needed:

```
1. Uncertainty Level Assessment
   - High: Significant unknowns that could invalidate approach
   - Medium: Some unknowns but precedents exist
   - Low: Well-understood with clear examples

2. Impact Assessment
   - High: Failure would significantly impact timeline, budget, or strategy
   - Medium: Failure would cause delays but project remains viable
   - Low: Failure easily recoverable with minimal impact

3. Time Availability
   - Sufficient: Time exists for thorough investigation
   - Limited: Some time available for focused investigation
   - None: Decision must be made immediately

Research Recommended: High Uncertainty + (High Impact OR Medium Impact with Sufficient Time)
```

### Research Method Selection

Choose methods based on question type and constraints:

| Question Type | Timeline | Method | Output |
|---------------|----------|--------|--------|
| User Needs | 1-2 weeks | User Interviews + Surveys | Validated personas, user stories |
| Market Opportunity | 2-3 weeks | Market Analysis + Competitive Research | Market sizing, positioning |
| Technical Feasibility | 1-5 days | Technical Spike | Architecture validation, performance data |
| Integration Complexity | 1-2 weeks | Proof of Concept | Working integration, complexity assessment |
| Business Viability | 1-3 weeks | Feasibility Study | Go/no-go recommendation, risk assessment |
