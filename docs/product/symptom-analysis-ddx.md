- **Technical Impact**: No intelligent assistance

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- [ ] Prescribe command exists
- [ ] Analyzes project context
- [ ] Provides relevant recommendations
- [ ] Links to applicable assets

### Symptom 6: No Self-Update Capability

**Observable Manifestation:**
- `ddx self-update` command missing
- Manual reinstallation required for updates
- No version checking mechanism

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Users**: All users after initial install
- **Business Impact**: Friction in staying current
- **Technical Impact**: Version fragmentation

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- [ ] Self-update command implemented
- [ ] Checks for new versions
- [ ] Downloads and replaces binary
- [ ] Preserves user configuration

## Medium Priority Symptoms (P2)

### Symptom 7: No Search Functionality

**Observable Manifestation:**
- `ddx search` command not implemented
- Cannot search across asset descriptions
- Must browse manually through lists

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Users**: Users with specific needs
- **Business Impact**: Slower asset discovery
- **Technical Impact**: Reduced efficiency

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- [ ] Search command implemented
- [ ] Full-text search across metadata
- [ ] Returns relevant results
- [ ] Performance <500ms

### Symptom 8: Missing Validation Commands

**Observable Manifestation:**
- `ddx validate` not implemented
- `ddx diagnose --phase=<phase>` not working
- No configuration validation

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Users**: Users following workflows
- **Business Impact**: Cannot ensure compliance
- **Technical Impact**: Manual validation required

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- [ ] Validation framework implemented
- [ ] Phase-specific validators exist
- [ ] Configuration schema validation
- [ ] Clear validation reports

### Symptom 9: No Plugin Architecture

**Observable Manifestation:**
- No plugin loading mechanism
- No extension points defined
- Cannot add custom commands

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected Users**: Advanced users and enterprises
- **Business Impact**: Limited extensibility
- **Technical Impact**: Core team bottleneck

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- [ ] Plugin interface defined
- [ ] Plugin loading mechanism
- [ ] Plugin discovery and registration
- [ ] Plugin isolation and security

## Symptom Correlation Matrix

| Symptom | Blocks | Blocked By | Related To |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|
| No Installation | All features | None | Distribution |
| Missing Workflows | CDP adoption | None | Init, Apply |
| Incomplete Init | Template usage | None | Apply, Workflows |
| No Metadata | Search, Filter | None | List, Prescribe |
| No Prescribe | Recommendations | Metadata | Diagnose |
| No Self-Update | Version management | Installation | None |
| No Search | Discovery | Metadata | List, Prescribe |
| No Validation | Quality assurance | Workflows | Diagnose |
| No Plugins | Extensions | None | All commands |

## Diagnostic Summary

### Overall Health Score: 35/100

**Breakdown:**
- Core Functionality: 40% (basic commands work)
- User Experience: 25% (significant gaps)
- Ecosystem Features: 20% (minimal community features)
- Enterprise Readiness: 15% (missing critical features)

### Treatment Priority

1. **Immediate (Sprint 1)**
   - Installation mechanism
   - Workflow commands
   - Complete init command

2. **Short-term (Sprint 2-3)**
   - Asset metadata system
   - Prescribe command
   - Self-update capability

3. **Medium-term (Sprint 4-6)**
   - Search functionality
   - Validation framework
   - Plugin architecture

## Validation Requirements

Before proceeding to the Prescribe phase, we must:

- [ ] Validate symptom completeness with stakeholders
- [ ] Confirm severity assessments
- [ ] Verify diagnostic criteria are measurable
- [ ] Ensure all symptoms have root cause analysis
- [ ] Get sign-off on treatment priorities

## Next Steps

1. Review this symptom analysis with stakeholders
2. Refine diagnostic criteria based on feedback
3. Create detailed technical specifications (Prescribe phase)
4. Develop implementation plan with timelines
5. Begin treatment (implementation) of critical symptoms
