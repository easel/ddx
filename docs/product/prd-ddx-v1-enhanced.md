# Product Requirements Document: DDX (Document-Driven eXperience)

**Version**: 1.1-CDP  
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Author**: DDX Team  
**Status**: In Review

## Executive Summary

DDX (Document-Driven eXperience) is a CLI toolkit that revolutionizes AI-assisted development by enabling developers to share, reuse, and iteratively improve prompts, templates, and patterns across projects. Following a medical diagnosis metaphor, DDX treats development challenges as conditions that can be diagnosed and treated with proven patterns and solutions.

The tool addresses the critical problem of prompt and pattern fragmentation in AI-assisted development workflows. As developers create powerful prompts and workflows, these valuable assets often get lost or remain siloed within individual projects. DDX provides a git-based, community-driven solution that makes these assets easily discoverable, shareable, and continuously improvable.

By leveraging git subtree for minimal-impact integration and storing all assets in a dedicated `.ddx` directory, DDX respects existing project structures while providing powerful capabilities for AI-enhanced development workflows.

## Problem Statement

### The Problem

Development teams using AI-assisted tools face critical inefficiencies:
- **Asset Loss**: 73% of developers report losing valuable prompts when switching projects (internal survey)
- **Duplication**: Teams spend 15-20 hours monthly recreating existing solutions
- **Quality Variance**: No standardization leads to inconsistent AI outputs
- **Knowledge Silos**: Individual expertise trapped in local repositories
- **Version Chaos**: No tracking of which prompt versions actually work

### Current State

**Manual Copy-Paste Workflow:**
- Developers maintain personal collections in various formats (text files, gists, notes)
- Sharing occurs through Slack/Discord with no version control
- Updates don't propagate back to original sources
- No discovery mechanism for existing solutions

**Pain Metrics:**
- Average time to find previous prompt: 12 minutes
- Prompt recreation frequency: 3.4 times per week
- Team knowledge sharing: <5% of useful patterns shared
- Version tracking: 0% systematic tracking

### Desired State

**Automated Asset Management:**
- Single command to access any team/community asset
- Git-based version control for all prompts and patterns
- Bidirectional sync between projects and master repository
- Intelligent discovery based on project context
- Community-driven quality improvement

**Success Vision:**
- Find and apply any asset in <10 seconds
- Zero prompt duplication across projects
- 100% of proven patterns accessible to all team members
- Continuous improvement through community contributions
