# Product Requirements Document: DDX (Document Driven eXperience)

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Author**: DDX Team
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

DDX (Document Driven eXperience) is a CLI toolkit that revolutionizes AI-assisted development by enabling developers to share, reuse, and iteratively improve prompts, templates, and patterns across projects. Following a medical diagnosis metaphor, DDX treats development challenges as conditions that can be diagnosed and treated with proven patterns and solutions.

The tool addresses the critical problem of prompt and pattern fragmentation in AI-assisted development workflows. As developers create powerful prompts and workflows, these valuable assets often get lost or remain siloed within individual projects. DDX provides a git-based, community-driven solution that makes these assets easily discoverable, shareable, and continuously improvable.

By leveraging git subtree for minimal-impact integration and storing all assets in a dedicated `.ddx` directory, DDX respects existing project structures while providing powerful capabilities for AI-enhanced development workflows.

## 1. Product Overview

### Vision
Become the go-to toolkit for sharing assets that support day-to-day use of agentic workflows, creating an ecosystem where AI-assisted development best practices are continuously refined and shared across the global developer community.

### Mission  
Enable developers and teams to capture, share, and iteratively improve the prompts, templates, and patterns that unleash the power of AI agents, making advanced AI workflows accessible and reusable across projects and organizations.

### Objectives
- Eliminate the loss and duplication of valuable AI prompts and patterns
- Enable seamless sharing of development assets between projects and teams
- Build a community-driven ecosystem of continuously improving AI workflows
- Support not just development, but broader business workflows including product management, contract management, and strategic research
- Maintain minimal project impact through thoughtful architecture and git subtree integration

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem
Creating effective prompts for AI agents requires significant effort and expertise. Once created, these valuable assets are frequently lost, forgotten, or remain trapped within individual projects. Developers repeatedly solve the same problems, recreating prompts and patterns that already exist elsewhere. There's no standard way to share, version, and improve these AI workflow assets across projects and teams.

### Current State
- Developers copy-paste prompts between projects manually
- Valuable patterns are lost when developers change projects or roles
- Teams lack visibility into proven AI workflows from other teams
- No version control or systematic improvement of prompts
- AI agent capabilities are underutilized due to lack of discoverable patterns

### Desired State
A thriving ecosystem where:
- Powerful prompts and patterns are easily shared and discovered
- Best practices evolve through community contribution
- Every project benefits from collective intelligence
- AI workflows become as shareable and versionable as code
- Developers spend time innovating, not recreating existing solutions
