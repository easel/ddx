  setup: |
    1. Decide which directories Claude should access
    2. Add directory paths as command arguments:
       - During installation, you'll be prompted for paths
       - Or set FILESYSTEM_PATHS environment variable
    3. Consider using read-only mode for safety
    4. Paths must be absolute (not relative)
  permissions:
    - Read: List and read file contents
    - Write: Create, modify, delete files (if not read-only)
    - Directory operations: Create, remove directories
  examples:
    - "List files in /Users/me/Projects"
    - "Read the contents of README.md"
    - "Create a new file called notes.txt"
    - "Search for Python files in the current directory"
  security_notes: |
    - Only grant access to necessary directories
    - Avoid granting access to system directories
    - Use read-only mode when write access isn't needed
    - Be cautious with home directory access

  warnings:
    - "Grants filesystem access - only allow necessary directories"
    - "Can modify/delete files if not in read-only mode"
    - "Avoid granting access to sensitive directories"
  recommendations:
    - "Use read-only mode when possible"
    - "Limit to specific project directories"
    - "Never grant access to system directories"
    - "Avoid home directory root access"
