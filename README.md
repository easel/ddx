# DDX - Document-Driven Development eXperience

> The knowledge management toolkit that solves lost knowledge, enables rapid iteration, and ensures reproducibility in AI-assisted development

## The Problem

Every development team faces the same critical challenges:

- **Lost Knowledge**: 73% of developers lose valuable prompts, patterns, and configurations when switching between projects
- **Duplicated Effort**: Teams spend 15-20 hours monthly recreating solutions that already exist elsewhere
- **Inconsistent Practices**: No standardization leads to varying code quality and unpredictable AI outputs across teams
- **Version Chaos**: No systematic tracking of which prompts, templates, or patterns actually work
- **Knowledge Silos**: Individual expertise remains trapped in local repositories with less than 5% of useful patterns ever shared

The cost compounds daily - every moment without a solution means more lost knowledge, more duplicated effort, and more missed opportunities to leverage collective intelligence.

## What is DDX?

DDX (Document-Driven Development eXperience) is a CLI toolkit that revolutionizes how developers manage, share, and reuse development assets. Think of it as npm for your development knowledge - prompts, templates, patterns, and workflows - all version-controlled, shareable, and continuously improving.

### Core Capabilities

- **üìö Asset Management**: Organize and version control prompts, templates, patterns, and configurations
- **üîÑ Git-Native Sync**: Built on git subtree for reliable bidirectional synchronization
- **üöÄ Zero Friction**: Single binary, no dependencies, works everywhere
- **ü§ñ AI Integration**: First-class support for AI prompts, personas, and MCP servers
- **üîç Project Intelligence**: Analyze and improve your development setup automatically
- **üë• Community Driven**: Share improvements that benefit everyone

## Quick Start

**One-line installation:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easel/ddx/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Initialize in your project:**
```bash
cd your-project
ddx init
```

**Discover what's available:**
```bash
ddx list              # See all available resources
ddx doctor            # Check installation and diagnose issues
ddx prompts list      # Browse AI prompts
ddx templates list    # View project templates
```

**Apply resources:**
```bash
ddx templates apply nextjs          # Apply a Next.js template
ddx prompts show code-review         # View a code review prompt
ddx patterns apply error-handling    # Add error handling patterns
```

## How DDX Works

### 1. Local-First Architecture

DDX stores all assets in a `.ddx/` directory within your project, keeping your development knowledge close to your code while maintaining clean separation:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .ddx/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/        # AI prompts and instructions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/      # Project and file templates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/       # Reusable code patterns
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/        # Tool configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                # Your application code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .ddx.yml           # DDX configuration
```

### 2. Git-Based Synchronization

DDX leverages git's proven capabilities for version control and collaboration:

```bash
ddx update        # Pull latest improvements from the community
ddx contribute    # Share your improvements back
```

Every change is tracked, versioned, and attributable. No magic, just git.

### 3. Variable Substitution

Templates and patterns adapt to your project through smart variable substitution:

```yaml
# .ddx.yml
variables:
  project_name: "my-app"
  database: "postgresql"
  auth_provider: "auth0"
```

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

Start simple, grow as needed:
- Begin with just prompts for AI assistance
- Add templates as you standardize practices
- Introduce patterns for common solutions
- Adopt complete workflows when ready

- **Consistency**: Same high-quality patterns across all projects

### Team Benefits
- **Standardization**: Entire team uses same practices
- **Onboarding**: New members productive immediately
- **Quality Control**: Validated patterns prevent common mistakes
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Expertise spreads naturally

### Community Benefits
- **Collective Intelligence**: Every improvement helps everyone
- **Battle-Tested Solutions**: Popular patterns proven across projects
- **Rapid Evolution**: Best practices emerge and spread quickly
- **Open Innovation**: Anyone can contribute improvements

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. AI Prompt Management
Store, version, and share your AI prompts:
```bash
# Browse available prompts
ddx prompts list

# Use a specific prompt
ddx prompts show testing/unit-test-generator

# Share an improved prompt
ddx contribute
```

### 2. Project Standardization
Ensure consistent setup across projects:
```bash
# Initialize with a template
ddx init --template nextjs-enterprise

# Apply your team's standards
ddx patterns apply team-standards
```

### 3. Knowledge Preservation
Capture and reuse solutions:
```bash
# Document a solution as a pattern
ddx patterns create auth-flow

# Apply it in another project
ddx patterns apply auth-flow
```

### 4. Tool Configuration
Share and maintain tool configs:
```bash
# Apply ESLint configuration
ddx configs apply eslint-strict

# Use team's prettier settings
ddx configs apply prettier-team
```

## Advanced Features

### Persona System

DDX includes a sophisticated persona system for consistent AI interactions:

```yaml
# .ddx.yml
personas:
  bindings:
    code-reviewer: strict-code-reviewer
    architect: systems-thinker
    tester: test-driven-developer
```

Personas ensure AI assistants maintain consistent behavior across your team, providing predictable, high-quality interactions.

### MCP Server Management

DDX manages Model Context Protocol servers as project-local dependencies:

```bash
# Install an MCP server
ddx mcp install filesystem

# Automatically configures in .claude/settings.json
# Server runs from local node_modules
```

This ensures reproducible AI tool configurations across your team.

### Project Diagnosis

DDX can check your installation and analyze your project:

```bash
ddx doctor

# Output:
‚úì DDx Binary Executable
‚úì PATH Configuration
‚úì Configuration Valid
‚úì Git Available
‚ö† Network Issues (optional)
‚ö† No CI/CD configuration found
  ‚Üí Consider: ddx templates apply github-actions
‚úì TypeScript configured
```

## Workflows: Structured Methodologies

While DDX excels at managing individual assets, it also supports complete development workflows - comprehensive methodologies that orchestrate multiple assets and practices.

### HELIX Workflow

One powerful workflow available through DDX is **HELIX** - a six-phase engineering methodology that brings decades of software engineering principles to AI-assisted development:

```bash
# Initialize HELIX in your project
ddx workflows apply helix
```

HELIX enforces quality through:
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written before implementation
- **Phase Gates**: Can't skip ahead or proceed without validation
- **Human-AI Optimization**: Clear responsibilities for both human and AI
- **Built-in Security**: DevSecOps practices integrated throughout
- **Systematic Progress**: Each phase builds on validated previous work

The six phases ensure forward momentum:
1. **Frame** - Define what to build and why
2. **Design** - Architect how to build it
3. **Test** - Write failing tests (Red phase)
4. **Build** - Implement to pass tests (Green phase)
5. **Deploy** - Release with monitoring
6. **Iterate** - Learn and improve

### Custom Workflows

Organizations can create and distribute their own workflows through DDX:

```bash
# Apply your organization's workflow
ddx workflows apply company-sdlc

# Share workflow improvements
ddx contribute --workflow
```

## Architecture & Design

### Design Principles

1. **Simple**: Single binary, no runtime dependencies
2. **Reliable**: Built on proven git technology
3. **Flexible**: Works with any language, framework, or tool
4. **Respectful**: Never modifies your code without permission
5. **Portable**: Runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows
